<p class="noindent">We would like to acknowledge the generous help of the Swiss National Fonds in providing us with the opportunity of spending time in Switzerland working on the book, Head in Berne and Zurich and Church in Fribourg. Equally, we must thank the host departments concerned, the Institut für Schweizergeschichte and André Holenstein in Berne, the Historisches Seminar and Simon Teuscher in Zurich, and Institut für schweizerische Zeitgeschichte in Fribourg for providing such welcoming and supportive environments. We also owe a great deal to the Swiss libraries and institutions who have helped us, including the National Library in Berne, the Schweizerisches Landesmuseum in Zurich and the Swiss Historical Dictionary, and notably Lucienne Hubler and Stephanie Summermatter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On a more personal level, we have both contracted many debts of gratitude to Swiss colleagues. In the initial gestation of the project, the support of Thomas Cottier and Thomas Maissen was critical. They set it on its way. Later Urs Altermatt, Catherine and Louis Bosshart, Paolo Dardanelli, François Jequier, David Luginbühl, Thomas Metzger, Carlo Moos, Damir Skenderovic, Siegfried Werklein and Michel Walter all discussed, provided suggestions and, especially, read drafts for Church. He is also grateful for the inspiration of the late Christopher Hughes and for the help of Pro Helvetia in earlier times. Regula Schmid read drafts of two chapters for Head, who also extends thanks to Thomas Maier, Rainer Hugener and the historians at the Arbeitsstelle Culmanstrasse for their support. Their friendship and support were greatly appreciated. However, none of the above is responsible for any of the work’s errors. Finally, we are also grateful to anonymous readers, to Liz Friend Smith, Elizabeth Spicer and Jo Breeze of CUP and their colleagues, and to the many Swiss individuals and institutions who helped us with images, maps and charts.</p>
