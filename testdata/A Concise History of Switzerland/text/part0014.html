<p class="noindent">A dense web of political ties bound the Swiss Confederacy together by 1500. The Confederacy’s emergence paralleled developments across Eur ope, which was increasingly dominated by coherent states – in the west, the new monarchies of Spain , France and England, and in the band from the Netherlands to Italy , a combination of sizeable princely states and a few important republics, including Venice , the Swiss Confederacy, and eventually the Dutch Republic. The trajectory of Swiss development took unexpected directions in the early sixteenth century, however, because of Swiss troops’ declining potency and even more because of the Protestant Reformation and the resulting schism , which bitterly divided the Confederacy. Indeed, the Confederacy became an important centre for the development and spread of Protestant ideas with the preaching and church leadership of Ulrich Zwingli (1484–1531) and Heinrich Bullinger (1504–75) in Zurich , together with Jean Calvin (1509–64) in Geneva . In addition, the Anabaptis t movement, predecessor of the modern Mennonite and Amish as well as many other community-based sectarian churches, had some of its earliest origins in Switzerland. Religious schism deeply divided the cantons, and brought institutional developments to a halt. Despite division, ironically, the national myths of the Swiss continued to evolve into the 1570s, and became widely disseminated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Thirty Years War (1618–48) was a cataclysmic struggle that devastated much of the Holy Roman Empire – but not Switzerland. Rather, despite internal religious division, the Confederacy remained neutral , although the associated Grisons were drawn into the war and <a id="page_74" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>suffered in consequence. At the end of the war, the overheated economy’s decline, exacerbated by a corruptly executed devaluation of the coinage, triggered a massive peasant revolt in the midlands . The Swiss Peasants’ War of 1653 briefly united peasants from across the Confederacy, whose ‘parliament’ unsuccessfully demanded a permanent voice in Swiss politics. Once social unrest had ebbed, religious tensions triggered another civil war between Catholics and Protestants that ended with Protestant defeat and the reaffirmation of the religious status quo in the Third Landfrieden of 1656. Although the intensity of religious disputes waned by 1700, the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3727">Landfrieden</a></span> remained contentious because it regulated the condominiums. In 1712, disputes over religious issues, primarily in the Toggenburg , led to another short civil war . This time Zurich and Berne dominated, leading to a final, Fourth Landfrieden that strengthened the Reformed cantons’ position in the condominiums , though leaving the Catholic cantons’ territory and churches intact.</p>
<p class="calibre4">During this tumultuous period, Switzerland came to be viewed as a distinct nation in Europe. The Peace of Westphalia that ended the Thirty Years War brought Switzerland complete exemption from imperial law, completing a process of divergence from the Empire. After 1648, the Confederacy acted as a sovereign state in the European concert of nations. Economic growth accelerated, especially the rural manufacturing known as proto-industrialization, and a pre-Alpine cheese industry emerged that produced for distant markets. Culturally, Switzerland remained conservative and cautious after 1648. However, the rigid orthodoxy of the period faced growing challenges as Protestant and Catholic intellectuals participated in the opening of European culture through the early Enlightenment.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-976"><span class="title">The Shape of the Old Confederacy, 1536–1798</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The arrangements among cities, rural cantons , abbeys, and other entities that made up the Confederacy were complex, but by the early 1500s, contemporaries simplified them into three categories – the cantons, the Associates (<span class="italic">Zugewandte</span>), and the condominiums (<span class="italic">Gemeine Herrschaften</span>, sometimes called Mandated Territories). After Berne ’s seizure of the Vaud in 1536, only minor changes in <a id="page_75" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>territory took place until the French revolutionary period. The Swiss Confederacy as a political actor consisted of the thirteen cantons (known in German simply as <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3711"><span class="italic">Orte</span></a></span>, ‘places’), divided into the old VIII and the new V. The VIII old cantons included the three cities Zurich , Berne and Lucerne and the five rural cantons Uri, Schwyz , Unterwalden, Zug and Glarus. The VIII old cantons spoke in order of rank at frequent Diets , and ruled, in various combinations, over the Confederacy’s condominiums. The V new cantons that became full members of the Confederacy after 1481 (Fribourg, Solothurn, Basle, Schaffhausen, Appenzell) all had long associations with the Confederacy, but had to defer to the old VIII in some matters.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-987"><img src="../images/00019.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">Figure 3.1 </span>The constitutional structure of the Old Confederacy</div>
<p class="calibre4">The Associates included a heterogeneous array of communities and lordships united only by their associations with the Confederacy. The large communal confederations in Valais and Grisons participated in the Swiss campaigns in Italy , but only sporadically visited the Diet, and remained largely autonomous in their foreign and internal affairs. Relations with the Associates Biel , Neuchâtel , and the abbey and the city of St Gallen, in contrast, grew more intense and more unequal during the sixteenth century, something even more true for smaller rural Associates such as the Toggenburg , Gruyère and <a id="page_76" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Saanen . Close ties with the Confederacy offered these smaller regions protection and stability, but at the cost of autonomy. Finally, relations with the two most distant Associates, the imperial cities of Mulhouse and Rottweil , declined to insignificance by the seventeenth century.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lowest in status, but pivotal for internal politics, were the condominiums in the Aargau, the Thurgau, the Ticino , the Rheintal above Lake Constance and the Sarganserland. Each came under the Confederacy’s control in a different way, and was governed by a particular set of cantons. The strategic location of the condominiums – the Aargau linking Berne , Zurich and Lucerne, the Ticino south of the Gotthard pass, the Rhine valley and Sarganserland connecting the Swiss with the Grisons passes – made them important for the Confederacy’s territorial integrity even if they produced little revenue. The rotating office of <span class="italic">Landvogt</span> or bailiff in each condominium brought prestige to its holders, while the need for oversight spurred regular meetings among each condominium’s ruling cantons. Shared responsibility and frequent meetings spurred the Confederacy ’s institutional consolidation in the fifteenth century; after the Reformation, the condominiums became critical locations for struggles between the faiths, since they were ruled by cantons confessing different religions and emerged from the early Reformation with religious ly divided populations.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite the Confederacy’s internal complexity, more and more contemporaries began thinking of the Swiss as forming <span class="italic">one</span> republic with its own distinct identity . Within Switzerland, this identity found expression in stories about William Tell and the Confederacy’s beginnings, which appeared both in official chronicles and in the arts and popular culture. This history became known across Europe when Zurich cleric Josias Simle r integrated it into his best-selling 1576 guide to the Confederacy, the <span class="italic">De Republica Helvetiorum Libri Duo</span> (Two Books about the Republic of the Helvetians). Because Swiss unity was not defined by a single ruler or by natural boundaries, however, its nature remained contested until the doctrine of the sovereign state allowed its integration into the European state system after 1648. Around 1500, the Swiss Confederacy appeared to be potent and open, an active participant in European affairs that might expand by assimilation or conquest. By 1715, the Confederacy was a stably constituted minor power with clear limits.</p>
<a id="page_77" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Swiss political life took place on three separate but connected levels. The Confederacy participated in the European politics of dynastic rivalries and sovereign states. The cantons and Associates constituted a second political sphere, bound by solidarity that put limits on each one’s freedom of action. Finally, each canton possessed an internal political life characterized by dynamic rivalries among factions, kin-groups, social classes and individuals. At each level, developments after 1500 echoed and amplified broader European trends toward caution, closure and the protection of vested interests. Across the Confederacy, privileged corporations, from local stockherders’ associations to urban councils, closed themselves to new members. The growing formality and complexity of administration further favoured exclusion, as magistrates increasingly used written documents to manage property and politics. Still, the privilege of all male citizens of communes to participate in decision-making, which retained great legitimacy in the Confederacy, set the Swiss apart from aristocratic Europe. In Valais , Grisons and the cantons with annual <span class="italic">Landsgemeinden</span> (assemblies of members), communal members voted directly, and occasionally resorted to force if their views were ignored. In the urban c antons, magistrates continued to consult urban citizens and rural subjects at crucial moments well into the sixteenth century. Typically, an uneasy balance existed between a few families who usually dominated politics and the remaining citizens who sought to share in power through consultative institutions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The almost complete exclusion of women from formal politics set Swiss practices apart from the aristocratic governance of other regions. Whereas kingdoms and lordship s in this period experienced a number of important women rulers, the republican focus of Switzerland provided no such opening, especially after the Reformation led to the abolition of most Swiss convents. Until the 1520s, the abbess of the Fraumünster in Zurich was the nominal sovereign of the city, for example, but no similar figures appear later. The strong association between bearing arms and full citizenship in Swiss communes – symbolized by Appenzell ’s requirement that each voter at the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3728">Landsgemeinde</a></span> bring his sword – blocked participation by women. Women also faced exclusion from guilds (even as the widows of guild masters) and economic life, though they did to appear as plaintiffs as well as defendants in the civil <a id="page_78" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>courts. While the wives of merchants and other wealthy men played a role in household and business management, as has been shown for the German imperial cities, the very scarcity of evidence about women’s lives in Switzerland reveals how a strong republican culture silenced their presence to an unusual degree.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1032"><img src="../images/00020.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">3.1 </span>After battle (drawing by Urs Graf). Widespread participation in mercenary service made many Swiss aware of the horrors of warfare. Basle artist Urs Graf, who himself took part in a number of campaigns in Italy, captured the devastation that followed battles in his drawings for private patrons. Popular resentment at the suffering of soldiers was increased by the ostentatious wealth that mercenary recruiters and the Confederacy’s political leaders gained from the soldiers’ hardships.</div>
<p class="calibre4">The end of official Swiss participation in the Italian Wars after 1516 did not produce greater stability within the Confederacy . Thousands of troops still entered foreign service, and private recruiters thrived. As major defeats of Swiss regiments at Bicocca (1522) and Pavia (1525) demonstrated, however, the era of Swiss military invincibility was over. Anger at these losses combined with resentment of the wealthy in an era of economic uncertainty to encourage reform of the entire civic order. Even so, it was at just this moment that long-term relations <a id="page_79" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>with Switzerland’s two most powerful neighbours stabilized. Treaties in 1516 and 1521 made France the Confederacy’s closest ally, offering generous pensions to cantons and individuals in exchange for the ability to recruit mercenaries – a relationship that was to last for nearly three centuries. Emperor Maximilian renewed and extended the older Habsburg agreements with the Confederacy in 1511, and he and his grandson Charles V sometimes sought Swiss military support for their ventures. A 1512 alliance with Pope Julius II gave Swiss troops the privilege of carrying the papal arms and an image of the Virgin Mary on their banners, a matter of great pride. In 1520, the Swiss future looked bright.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-1042"><span class="title">Religious Schism and the Division of the Confederacy</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A powerful movement for church reform spread across the Europe after 1517, set off by Martin Luther in Germany and expanded in Switzerland by Ulrich Zwingli . Ultimately, the disputes set off by Zwingli’s prophetic preaching dominated political conflict in the Confederacy from the 1520s until the end of the seventeenth century. Not only spiritual issues were at stake: since religious orthodoxy and political legitimacy remained closely connected in European culture, the idea of sharing oaths and political identity with ‘heretics’ or ‘idolaters’ remained difficult on both sides of the schism . In practice, however, the Confederacy’s shared interest in its condominiums and in European politics would force cooperation even when religious hostility was high.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In 1500, a single institutional church preached orthodox doctrine and practice and enjoyed support across Western Europe. In the Swiss lands, numerous parish foundings and church improvements around 1500 showed that peasants and townspeople alike desired better clerical services and a vibrant religious life. Many voices called for a <span class="italic">better</span> church, but few called for radical changes. By 1600, in contrast, Europe was divided among competing ‘confessional’ churches (that is, each adhering to its own confession of faith) whose clergies attacked their rivals as heretical servants of the Antichrist. In some Swiss cantons, along with England, Scotland, and the Netherlands, the Reformed movement originating in Zurich <a id="page_80" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_81" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> with Zwingli and continued by Jean Calvin in Geneva became the official church. The Roman Church, too, reformed its organization and teachings at the Council of Trent (1543–62), and reached out energetically after the 1550s to support Catholic Europeans, including the many Swiss who remained Catholic. Both churches in Switzerland claimed a monopoly on religious truth, and required obedience and public adherence to their tenets.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1052"><img src="../images/00021.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">3.2 </span>Ulrich Zwingli in 1531. Zwingli came from the rural hinterland of the Toggenburg, via Glarus and the abbey of Einsiedeln, to serve as the main preacher in Zurich in 1519. His blunt preaching, founded on experience as a military chaplain and familiarity with the work of Erasmus and Luther, spoke to a broad spectrum of Swiss, from urban patricians’ sons to handworkers. Zwingli’s conviction that he had been appointed to a prophetic mission helped bring about his death on the battlefield of Kappel in 1531.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Born of an established Toggenburg family in 1484, Ulrich Zwingli exemplified a generation of intellectually ambitious clergymen. He attended Latin school s in Basle and Berne before studying in Vienna from 1499 to 1506. Zwingli’s qualifications gained him a call to Glarus as parish priest, where he served for ten years. His duties included accompanying soldiers on their campaigns in Italy, including the battle at Marignano, which made him a vocal critic of mercenary service. A new position in Einsiedeln offered Zwingli the opportunity to concentrate on theological study after 1516, focusing on the Church Fathers. By the time he was selected as cathedral preacher in Zurich late in 1518, Martin Luther’s works had upended the debate about church reform. Like Luther , Zwingli was a passionate preacher who did not hesitate to break from tradition about the meaning of the Gospel. His preaching found a ready audience, reaching leading men, guildsmen and their families, and Zurich’s rural subjects . Importantly, several young men from prominent families, fervent supporters of Zwingli’s teaching, persuaded their relatives on the city council to protect Zwingli from prosecution for his views.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A visible break with the old church took place in Zurich during Lent in 1522, when the printer Christoph Froschauer gave his workers sausage for supper. This act violated the Church’s and the city’s laws on fasting before Easter. Zwingli preached the following week on Christians’ freedom from dietary regulations, making his defiance of church authority public, and the city council chose not to punish the violators. Zwingli’s further sermons on clerical celibacy and the veneration of images widened the breach in 1522, making it clear that new religious ideas had spread into the Confederacy. Concerned, the Swiss Diet in 1522 issued a call to avoid ‘innovation’ in religion, but execution remained in the hands of the cantons. In Zurich, the magistrates responded by organizing a disputation that followed an agenda <a id="page_82" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> provided by  Zwingli, after which they ordered that preaching should be ‘according to the Gospel’, thus taking Zwingli’s position. Soon, the city ended celebration of the Mass, removed images from the city’s churches, and took over church responsibilities such as poor relief and the supervision of marriages and morals.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although Luther , Zwingli and Calvin shared a common perspective on ‘salvation by faith alone’, they parted ways on the consequences of this principle for a Christian society. In contrast to Luther, Zwingli and, after him, Calvin maintained that a well-ordered Christian community, while flawed, could nevertheless guide its members towards a way of life pleasing to God. The strong community life of southern <a id="page_83" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Germany and Switzerland may have encouraged the relative optimism of this perspective, or the reformist spirit of Humanism may have affected Zwingli and Calvin more than the scholastically trained Luther. Zwingli, his successor Heinrich Bullinger and Calvin produced highly influential tracts that described how a Christian society should be organized and treat its members. These ideas, along with specific theological differences with Luther, resulted in a new church separate both from the Catholic tradition and from the Lutheran church emerging in Germany.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1063"><img src="../images/00022.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">3.3 </span>First Zurich religious disputation, 1523: caught between the popular appeal of Zwingli’s teaching and the dangers of challenging Europe’s religious order, the Zurich magistrates staged a theological disputation in 1523. Although they invited their bishop to prove Zwingli’s errors, Zwingli set the agenda, showing that the disputation’s primary purpose was to consolidate support behind his ideas. The city council set the city on a clear path of religious change after the disputation, anchored in the city’s self-government.</div>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1064"><img src="../images/00023.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">3.4 </span>Iconoclasm in Stadelhofen. Zwingli’s preaching in Zurich inspired both urban and rural lay preachers to read and interpret the Bible. Whereas Zwingli deferred to the city’s magistrates in political matters, and defended tithes and infant baptism, some of his followers adopted a form of biblical literalism that rejected oaths, baptism and all use of images in religious services. The picture shows radicals tearing down a cross in the Zurich village of Stadelhofen. Magistrates in Reformed and Catholic regions alike punished such ‘Anabaptists’ harshly, but popular support allowed small radical communities to survive for centuries.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Although Zwingli rejected the old church, his willingness to defend practices such as tithes led some of his earliest followers to reject his ideas as excessively deferential to worldly concerns. These radicals, including both laypeople and trained clerics, questioned all existing arrangements in the church and in the world. Some pointed out that Jesus and his disciples had been baptized only as adults, and therefore argued that infant baptism was unbiblical, gaining them the epithet Anabaptists (‘rebaptizers’). Others, citing Scripture, felt that Christians must refuse to take oaths, which were a fundamental element of social cohesion in early modern Europe. Traditionalists and reformers alike not only rejected the radicals’ ideas, but also connected them with social unrest, especially after the German Peasants’ War of 1525 revealed the potency of popular desire for religious change. Persecution of the Anabaptists began almost immediately, and continued on the part of both Catholic and Protestant authorities over the next two centuries.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because Berne was the most populous canton in the Confederacy, its choices were particularly important for the future of the evangelical movement. Although considerable sympathy for evangelical ideas developed among the citizens, the city’s leaders remained cautious. But popular opinion increasingly favoured the new teachings, and in 1528 the magistrates introduced the new church in Berne and imposed it on the more reluctant countryside. Basle and Schaffhausen also adopted the new ideas in the late 1520s, whereas Fribourg, Solothurn and most importantly Lucerne suppressed local evangelicals and stayed loyal to Catholicism. Most of the rural cantons also stayed Catholic, forming a solid bloc in central Switzerland; only Glarus and Appenzell had successful Zwinglian movements, which eventually led to bi-confessional governance in Glarus and division of the canton in <a id="page_84" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> Appenzell. The heterogeneous Associates experienced heterogeneous outcomes, with strong Reformed movements in Grisons and Biel, but adherence to the old church in Valais and Rottweil.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After 1523, the rapid spread of Zwinglian worship increasingly occupied the Diet ’s agenda. Deeply held beliefs and practices on both sides made compromise difficult, while the emergence of radical positions made the new movement seem more threatening. From 1525 to 1529, tensions rose every time another canton chose to embrace or reject Zwinglian ideas. Zwingli himself continued to publish works articulating his theological position, which gained resonance well beyond the Confederacy. As his influence grew, so did Zwingli’s conviction of his calling as a prophet: the urgency of his cause and the importance of reforming Christian society led him to demand political as well as spiritual action to spread <a id="page_85" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>his faith. His intransigence pushed the Confederacy closer to open conflict.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Events in 1525 added to the tensions from the growing religious schism. Just north of the Swiss border, hundreds of thousands of German peasants and townspeople took up arms against their lords, demanding both secular reform and free preaching of the Gospel. Local unrest broke out within the Confederacy, as well, beginning when peasants stormed and destroyed the Thurgau cloister of Ittingen in 1524. The Catholic cantons had to decide how to respond to such unrest, and to increasingly bold moves by the Zwinglians in the Confederacy. In February 1529, for example, the magistrates in St Gallen , with support from Zurich, seized the abbey as Abbot Franz von Gaisberg lay dying, and introduced Zwinglian worship in the abbey’s rural territory. The Reformed cities also established a defensive alliance, which also included St Gallen, Constance and Mulhouse . In response, the Catholic cantons allied with the Habsburgs, who promised to defend the Catholics against attacks from Zurich in exchange for the right to recruit 6,000 troops.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In June 1529, Zurich’s magistrates declared war on the Catholic cantons, and Zurich and Schwyz mobilized their troops near the village and cloister of Kappe l on their border. Negotiations continued, however, since the rest of the Confederacy opposed a war. The troops probably fraternized, as well, and legend has it they shared a soup of milk and bread from a cauldron placed on the line between the two camps. On 26 June 1529, an agreement, the First Kappeler Landfrieden , was reached, and each side withdrew its forces. In the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3727">Landfrieden</a></span>, all cantons agreed to avoid coercion in matters of faith, and allowed communities in the condominiums to choose by majority vote whether to keep the traditional church or accept the new teachings. The first <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3727">Landfrieden</a></span> of 1529 stabilized matters only briefly. The Zurich council and preachers used its favourable terms to encourage parishes in the Thurgau to accept the new church and to attach themselves politically to the city, while Catholic bailiffs in other condominiums pressured communities to retain the old church. Growing religious tension in the Empire also fed into Swiss events. Eventually, Catholic frustration and Zurich’s pressure for further concessions triggered another, more violent confrontation. In May 1531, Zurich and its Reformed allies banned sales of grain from their markets to the <a id="page_86" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>V Catholic cantons. After negotiations stalled, this existential threat provoked Schwyz to declare war and move its troops toward Zurich. The war brought a devastating defeat for Zurich and for Zwingli’s supporters. Zwingli himself died at the Battle of Kappel on 11 October 1531, and the city experienced a second defeat on the Gubel on 24 October.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since Berne and the other Reformed cantons refused to support further hostilities, the Second Kappeler Landfrieden negotiated between the parties and sealed on 20 November 1531 favoured the victorious Schwyzer and the religious traditionalists. The agreement recognized the existence of two faiths and set out guidelines for their coexistence, which rapidly became part of the Confederacy’s fundamental laws. Crucially, each canton remained free to choose either the ‘true undoubted Christian faith’ of the Catholics or the ‘faith’ of the Zwinglians. While individual provisions as well as the document’s tone privileged Catholicism, the peace was thus a moderate document. It was also an early example of the emerging principle that local sovereigns enjoyed a choice among Christian confessions, as established in 1555 for the entire Holy Roman Empire . The political damage to both belligerents was serious, however. Moreover, religious difference still divided the Confederacy, and religious civil war recurred first in 1656, then again in 1712. Some historians call this the ‘confessional’ era across Europe, after the rival faiths that helped shape politics and culture through their conflicts.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-1097"><span class="title">Territorial Closure and Confessional Politics after 1531</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the west, one last conflict broke through the Confederacy’s increasingly passive stance in international affairs: the seizure of the Vaud from Savoy by Berne , Fribourg and Valais in 1536. The Bernese had long been both allies and rivals of the House of Savoy, and temporarily seized much of Vaud in 1475. Savoy’s restored authority remained precarious, owing to the Dukes’ many rivals. In Geneva, the pro-Confederacy faction grew rapidly after 1500, since the Dukes could neither protect Geneva ’s commercial interests nor preserve the peace. Tensions peaked in 1525 when Duke Charles III convened the city council in a room surrounded by armed soldiers, <a id="page_87" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>but this only encouraged the pro-Swiss ‘Eidgenouts’, who allied with Berne and Fribourg immediately after this incident. The subsequent Treaty of St Julien between Berne and the Duke in 1530 confirmed Savoy’s weakness, since it authorized Berne to intervene and even to seize Vaud if the treaty were violated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Berne’s influence also helped Protestant preaching gain a foothold in the Vaud; by 1534, Guillame Farel and several other preachers had established themselves in Geneva. In January 1536, invoking the Peace of St Julien, Bernese troops marched into the Vaud , pillaging castles, taking oaths from the population, and occupying Geneva and Lausanne. Fribourg and the Valais also seized Savoyard territory, and French soldiers occupied the remainder of the duchy, which they held until 1559. The Bernese initially claimed Lausanne and Geneva by right of conquest. The Geneva council successfully resisted, aided by the other cantons, but Lausanne joined Vaud in subjection to the Berne. These last Swiss acquisitions of territory thus entered the Confederacy partly as one new Associate , Geneva, whose status was unaffected by the fact that it was Francophone, and partly as extensive new Bernese subject territories. These, like earlier conquests in Italy, were administered in their own language and not in German.With these acquisitions, the Confederacy reached its final early modern extent.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Europe was torn by war and religious conflict in this era. Open war between Valois France and the Habsburgs through the century – often involving Swiss mercenaries – halted only briefly with the 1559 Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis, while Protestant footholds emerged in England , the Netherlands and Eastern Europe. Despite the Confederacy’s location directly between France and Austria, the Swiss did not become party to further wars. France valued the status quo in Switzerland because it provided a buffer for French-occupied Savoy and because the cantons sent regiments to serve the Kings of France. The Habsburgs, too, saw modest advantages in a neutralized Switzerland, while Emperor Charles V’s many other concerns made it prudent to avoid intervening in the Confederacy. The Reformed cantons did not join the Schmalkaldic League formed by the Lutherans of Germany, in part for theological reasons, keeping the Swiss out of the Schmalkaldic Wars . The policy of caution and <a id="page_88" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3741"><span class="italic">Stillstehen</span></a></span> that emerged in these years anticipated more formal expressions of Swiss neutrality in later European conflicts.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In Zurich, Zwingli’s replacement Heinrich Bullinger , who remained in office for over forty years, shaped both the Swiss Reformed churches and the entire European Reformed movement. In over 12,000 letters to ministers and learned men across Europe, he advised, encouraged, and sometimes despaired as the tides of politics and religion swept back and forth. He was especially important for formulating a series of increasingly precise confessions, formal statements of Reformed doctrine that became the foundation of the Swiss Reformed church. During his long career, Bullinger turned his attention to a wide variety of matters, including influential treatises against the Anabaptists and in favour of prosecuting witches, and even popular dramas.</p>

After Humanist studies in Paris, Calvin adopted evangelical ideas in the early 1530s; the French crown’s persecution of the movement drove him into exile shortly thereafter. After a stay in Strasbourg, he settled in Geneva, where he became head of the Reformed church established after the Bernese conquest of the Vaud in 1536. A powerful writer and determined reformer, he allied the Genevan church with the Reformed movement of German Switzerland. His theology and writings on church organization had even greater influence in Great Britain, France, Germany and eventually in the new world.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Geneva’s exposed position and dependence on Berne propelled the question of religious change in the city with particular intensity. The rapid introduction of the Reformation, along with developments in France and the Confederacy, soon brought a figure of European significance to the city: Jean Calvin. Calvin was an educated Frenchman who encountered the evangelical movement while studying in Paris, Bourges and Orleans. When royal pressure on heretics increased in mid-1533, he followed the path of many refugees through Strasbourg to Basle , where he issued the first edition of his major work, the <span class="italic">Christianae Religionis Institutio</span>, in 1536. This book became a guide for Reformed theology over the following decades, and immediately made Calvin a recognized figure. Later that year, he returned briefly to France, but when forced to flee, he took up a clerical position in Geneva. For the next thirty years, Calvin struggled against opposition both clerical and political to build the church he had imagined in the <span class="italic">Institutio</span>. Calvin held positions on many theological issues that resembed those of Luther and Zwingl i, along with some that diverged from both. During the 1540s and 1550s, he participated in Europe-wide efforts to find a religious compromise, including the Colloquy of Regensburg in 1541, but eventually moved into closer alignment with the Zurich church headed by Bullinger. Given Geneva ’s vulnerable location, such an alliance made political sense, but theological issues, especially over the real presence, also encouraged the formation of the unified Swiss Reformed church, preaching in German and French , <a id="page_89" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_90" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>which obtained its mature doctrinal form in Bullinger’s Second Helvetic Confession of 1564. By building up a church on the border of France that energetically supported the evangelical movement there, and by shaping Reformed ideas about church governance into a coherent package, Calvin shaped the religious evolution of the entire continent and left a profound mark on the Reformed church across Switzerland as well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Religious refugees from diverse origins provided crucial pathways for religious ideas to spread in this period – not just Calvin’s, but also Anabaptist and other radical teachings. Evangelical refugees to Switzerland played an important role, particularly the wave of English Protestants fleeing the Catholicism of Queen Mary I in 1553. Radical refugees to the Confederacy fared less well. The most famous was the Spanish physician and anti-Trinitarian Michael Servetus , who escaped from a French Inquisition prison and fled to Geneva. Calvin adjudged his ideas blasphemous for denying the Trinity. Consequently, when Servetus was recognized attending church, the Geneva n magistrates seized and executed him with Calvin’s approval, triggering one of the first European debates over the use of coercion in religious matters. Many Anabaptist s also fled <span class="italic">from</span> Switzerland for havens in Eastern Europe, and later in the New World.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The most dangerous part of Europe after 1560 was France, where a weakened monarchy faced powerful noble clans divided by religion. The Hugueno t party maintained close ties with Geneva and the Reformed cities, while the strongly Catholic faction headed by the house of Guise relied on support from Spain , Savoy and the Catholic Swiss. Swiss mercenaries thus served on all sides of the French civil war that raged from 1561 to 1593. The war undermined the French alliance with the Confederacy as a whole, and threatened to bring Swiss troops face-to-face in battle again. Savoy’s efforts to regain the Vaud, backed by ultra-Catholic Spain and pursued in part by shifting alliances with the Catholic cantons, also raised tensions in western Switzerland.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Growing religious polarization within the Confederacy reached a first peak in the 1580s. In addition to disputes about Geneva, the Bishop of Basle was at loggerheads with his city over rural territories, and tempers flared over a polemical book published in Fribourg with the encouragement of the Jesuit rector there, Peter Canisius. In 1586, <a id="page_91" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>the Catholic cantons established a new alliance among themselves known as the Golden League. Protestants immediately expressed anger at a clause that not only protected the Catholic religion, but also stated that ‘no older or newer alliance, whether already established or established in the future, shall hinder us in such protection’. This provision seemed to override the existing alliances that constituted the Confederacy . In 1587, despite new protests from the Protestant cantons, the V cantons and Fribourg also agreed to a defensive and mercenary treaty with the King of Spain.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-1158"><span class="title">The Confessional Century:</span><span class="subtitle">Religion, Politics and Culture in the 1600S</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Swiss Confederacy entered the seventeenth century bitterly divided along religious lines, in parallel with Europe and the Holy Roman Empire . Yet the latter were drawn into a devastating war from 1618 to 1648, whereas the Confederacy managed to remain internally at peace and externally neutral. The pattern of neutrality during European wars that was set during the Thirty Years War became a fixed part of Switzerland’s interactions with its European neighbourhood, eventually reaching formal status at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. When the Thirty Years War ended, however, Switzerland soon experienced two major internal conflicts: the Peasants’ War of 1653 and the First War of Villmergen in 1656. Understanding political developments after 1600 thus requires attention both to the confessional cultures that had emerged and to how the Confederacy’ s political network blunted the conflicts that these cultures provoked.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1167"><img src="../images/00025.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">3.6 </span>The Escalade in Geneva, 1602. Religious and political tension inside and around the Confederacy peaked around 1600, and included a failed coup sponsored by the Duke of Savoy in 1602. Geneva’s citizens succeeded in blocking the entry of the full Savoyard force, and survived the attack. Although the Catholic cantons prevented Geneva from becoming a full member of the Confederacy, it remained safely within the Swiss fold after this date, and represented an important cultural and economic gateway to France.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Separation and polarization driven by religious difference affected every aspect of life in seventeenth-century Switzerland, from politics to family life to reading habits. Local religious constellations ranged from sizeable blocs committed to a single confession, such as central cantons around Lucerne or the Bernese territories, to side-by-side Catholic and Reformed congregations in a single village and sharing a single church, as in some condominiums . Even in religiously homogeneous territories, however, contact across confessional lines was frequent because of economic and social ties. For clerical and secular authorities, the resulting mingling was a source of constant anxiety <a id="page_92" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> as they struggled to teach and discipline the general population. Yet it also meant that everyone in the Swiss lands had some experience with people of differing religious persuasion, often at very close range.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At moments of high tension, voices on each side demanded that the bi-confessional Confederacy should be abandoned. After the crisis over the Golden League of 1586, another set of struggles in the 1620s developed between the Abbot of St Gallen and Reformed villages in the condominiums ; brought to the Diet, intransigence on both sides led to deadlock. Each confessional party trumpeted catalogues of ‘abuses’ perpetrated by the other, while refusing all compromise. In the early 1630s, Schwyz even suggested dividing the condominiums, rather than continuing joint control. Yet at <a id="page_93" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>each juncture, other voices defended confederate traditions and the need for cooperation. Despite the clergy’s misgivings, the Zurich and Berne councils sent a delegation to Lucerne in 1585 to argue for unity, and received a return delegation from the Catholic cantons. In 1632, an agreement on how to negotiate confessional issues in the condominiums was reached, though there was little progress on the ground. Constant tension between impulses to separation, on the one hand, and the desire to sustain unity, on the other, shaped Swiss confessional culture in this era.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The dangers of involvement in great power rivalries amplified by confessional division became shockingly visible in the Grisons from 1616 to 1636. Because of its strategic passes, the Grisons republic was courted by both the Habsburgs, interested in connections between their Milan ese possessions and Austria, and by the Franco-Venetian alliance, which sought to block Habsburg mobility while moving German mercenaries to Venice . Rival factions within the Grisons, funded with bribes and pensions, struggled to control the republic through mass assemblies of the communal troops. When some Reformed pastors turned a 1618 assembly in Thusis to confessional ends, the backlash led first to invasion of the Valtellina by Milan (accompanied by a rebellion of Valtellina Catholics that included the slaughter of over 400 local Protestants), and then to an Austrian invasion of the Grisons. Rival armies brought looting, oppression and the plague throughout the 1620s and early 1630s, until the local elites united behind a Spanish alliance in 1639 and restored fragile order.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The chaos in the Grisons provided an object lesson on the virtues of neutrality to the XIII cantons and their subjects. The profits from sales of food and military materiel – above all horses – also made neutrality more attractive. A dangerous moment came in 1633, when Swedish troops marched through the Thurgau to encircle the Habsburg city of Constance . The Reformed captain of the territorial defence troops, Killian Kesselring , was accused of allowing the Swedish incursion, and the resulting trial nearly triggered another war between Zurich and Schwyz . Cooler heads prevailed, and Kesselring escaped with his life. Until the very end of the war, however, efforts towards a joint defence of Swiss borders failed because of confessional suspicions. Only in 1647 were the cantons able to agree on the modest <span class="italic">Defensionale</span> of Wil to patrol the north-eastern border.</p>
<a id="page_94" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">When the weary warring parties of Europe gathered in Westphalia to negotiate a peace, the Swiss at first saw no need to attend. Johann Rudolf Wettstein , the mayor of Basle, recognized the importance of the negotiations, however, and went to Westphalia to represent Switzerland. Although he arrived without credentials from the Diet , he succeeded in having the peace clarify the Confederacy’s legal and political status. Article VI declared the cantons ‘to be in possession of a quasi-full Liberty and Exemption from the Empire, and so in no way subject to the Tribunals and Sentences of the said Empire ’. Although short of explicit sovereignty , this formula confirmed that Switzerland was a separate entity on the international stage. The treaty was silent on the status of the Associates , but in practice, they gained the same privilege under the Swiss umbrella. The stability the Swiss had enjoyed, especially during the destructive 1630s, left a deep impression on contemporaries, and is celebrated in Grimmelshausen’s famous novel of the war, <span class="italic">Simplicissimus</span>.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Paradoxically, peace in Europe reignited conflict in the Confederacy. The war years had caused a boom in Swiss agriculture. Well-off peasants invested to meet German demand by taking on credit, even as a deteriorating climate and growing population made overall productivity decline. This local boom also disguised the frequent degradation of the petty coinage used in everyday transactions, caused by urban mints’ skimping on precious metal so as to increase state income for defence works and similar projects. The early 1650s reversed all these conditions: prices for grain and horses fell, putting the heavily leveraged upper peasantry into difficulty, while the harsher climate pressured the poor. When several Swiss cities suddenly devalued their coins while protecting urban investors at the cost of other regions, rebellion ensued. Protests began in the Entlebuch valley belonging to Lucerne: the leading peasants were hard hit by devaluation of Bernese coinage and by demands for taxes, and rose up to demand restoration of their ‘ancient privileges’. The revolt spread rapidly into Berne , Solothurn , and Basle ’s rural districts as well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In a series of negotiations intensified by the threat of violence, the peasants’ goals rapidly expanded beyond economic issues and the ‘old law’ they originally sought to restore. Instead, in three increasingly radical manifestos they sought to create a separate alliance among the entire Swiss peasantry , both Catholic and Protestant, <a id="page_95" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>‘since the authorities also ally themselves’. The peasant leaders justified their actions by calling on William Tell , the founder (as they believed) of the Confederacy:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<div class="calibre1">
<div class="poetry">Oh William Tell, I beseech you,</div>
<div class="poetry">Wake up from your sleep:</div>
<div class="poetry">The bailiffs want to have it all,</div>
<div class="poetry">Horses, cows, calves and sheep.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Here we see the historical myth ology of the late fifteenth century reformulated to support the rebels’ claims that they, not the urban elites that ruled them, were the true William Tells of their generation. The rebels also ignored divisions between Catholic and Protestant regions in organizing their revolutionary alliance; in parallel, Lucerne, Zurich and Berne cooperated across religious boundaries in suppressing the revolt. Intense negotiations under great pressure eventually fragmented the peasant front and led to a series of local agreements that restored order. Once the peasants had disbanded their militias, the authorities, especially in Berne , repudiated the negotiated amnesties and punished the rebellion’s leaders harshly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With the existing magistrates firmly in charge again, the political stalemate between the Catholic and Protestant cantons once again came to the fore. The Catholic majority at the Diet was aided by the unequal terms of the 1531 <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3727">Landfrieden</a></span>, which gave them disproportionate influence in the condominiums and on other issues, which they used to stall or resist complaints from their Reformed confederates. If one looked at population or wealth, in contrast, the Reformed cantons significantly outweighed the Catholic ones. The result was a dangerous brew of fear and resentment. When a conflict over a group of crypto-Protestants in the village of Arth broke out between perennial rivals Zurich and Schwyz late in 1655, this brew boiled over into a short confessional war, the First War of Villmergen . Zurich struck first early in 1656 by seizing the Thurgau and besieging the town of Rapperswil , but its assault quickly stalled. Meanwhile, a supporting contingent from Berne was defeated in a battle with Lucerne troops near the Aargau village of Villmergen on 24 January, with losses of some 600 men. After some further skirmishing, France and Savoy initiated negotiations that largely restored the status quo in March through a Third Landfrieden. Even in the troubled 1650s, neither the accumulated <a id="page_96" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> resentments of the peasantry nor the reignition of religious disputes sufficed to bring about significant changes in the Confederacy ’s structure. The bitterness of the division, however, encouraged both Catholic and Protestant cantons to develop the practice of meeting separately, leading to the emergence of <span class="italic">de facto</span> Catholic and Protestant Diets, as well as the common Diet s in Baden.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although the 1656 civil war showed that religion still divided the Confederacy, the emergence of more flexible religious ideas, especially on the Reformed side, caused the clergy growing concern. The rapid spread of René Descartes’s ideas among university professors undermined orthodox Protestant theology, while the teachings of the pastor Louis Tronchin and his students in Geneva offered a less dogmatic approach to religion that respected individual liberty of conscience. This so-called Enlightened Orthodoxy brought forth a vigorous response from conservative Protestant leaders in Switzerland, who imposed a new, rigidly orthodox <span class="italic">Formula Consensus</span> on teachers and pastors in 1675. Despite official approval by the Protestant Diet, signatures to the <span class="italic">Formula</span> came slowly, and an increasing number of leading figures refused to sign, especially in Basle . By 1706, the city no longer supported this effort to bolster orthodox religion, reflecting the growing influence of the early Enlightenment and the ongoing transformation of Europ ean intellectual culture.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Confessional divisions – entangled, as always, with political issues – nevertheless triggered one more civil war in Switzerland, the Second War of Villmergen in 1712. Behind this conflict lay decades of hostility between the Prince-Abbot of St Gallen and his largely Reformed subjects in the Toggenburg , who enjoyed substantial liberties and joint oversight by four of the Swiss cantons. The Abbot turned to the Habsburgs for support, while the Toggenburg population, which set up its own regime in 1707 after expelling the abbot’s bailiffs, looked to Zurich and Berne. In a calculated move, the two Reformed cities sent troops to the abbot’s lands in St Gallen as well as to the critical territorial link between Zurich and Berne in the Aargau in summer 1712. In contrast to 1656, the urban troops of the Reformed cities were well organized and professionally led – more than a match for the popular militias on which the Catholic cantons still relied. Recognizing the poor odds, the Catholic cantons approved a settlement that would have weakened Catholic privileges in the condominiums. This humiliating concession, <a id="page_97" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> however, triggered a popular uprising in Lucerne’s rural domains, supported by Uri , Schwyz and Unterwalden. Led by Catholic priests and their supporters among the village elites, the protests briefly rekindled the war against Zurich and Berne. Events quickly dashed the rebels’ hopes. When the armies met, again at the village of Villmergen , the Catholic forces suffered a devastating defeat with nearly 3,000 dead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The political shape of Switzerland for the rest of the eighteenth century was set in the Fourth <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3727">Landfrieden</a></span> , promulgated August 1712 in the Peace of Aarau . Zurich and Berne used their dominant position to force substantial changes in the Confederacy’s constitution, although without impinging on the territory or autonomy of the existing cantons. The Catholic cantons were excluded from the administration of much of the Aargau , and Berne was added to the rulers of the Thurgau . Strict parity in religious affairs in the condominiums was legislated in detail, ending the disadvantages that the Reformed congregations had faced under the previous <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3727">Landfrieden</a></span>. The Abbot of St Gallen regained his lordship over the Toggenburg under conditions that protected the Reformed majority there in worship and daily administration. The settlement generated great bitterness among the losers, but it also removed many of the petty irritants that had produced deadlock at the Confederacy’s Diet .</p>
<p class="calibre4">By 1715, the Confederacy was again pacified internally, and its external neutrality and sovereignty were widely recognized. The messy network of pacts, agreements, treaties and habits that controlled its governance might be hard to describe and often ineffective, but they provided stability and continued to evolve, so that the system as a whole functioned. The growing divisions between rich and poor found an echo in the continuing trend towards oligarchy in rural as well as urban cantons: a few powerful families benefited the most from the established order, as was the case all over Europe.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-1261"><span class="title">The Material World, 1500–1700</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Material life in Switzerland from 1500 to 1700 changed only incrementally, and patterns of production, reproduction and consumption remained similar. In 1600 as in 1500, Switzerland had a primarily agrarian economy, crafts took place largely in towns and <a id="page_98" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>cities and almost all labour relied on animal or human muscles for power . Water turned mills, and burning wood heated forges, bathhouses and residences, completing the range of energy sources. Yet slow but important changes took place in many aspects of material life, including the climate , population, trade and manufactures. By 1700, the spread of rural manufacturing of textiles and other goods circumvented the urban guilds and increased the commercialization of the countryside, as did the flourishing cheese industry, even as the pass trade declined in relative importance. Throughout the period, the financial strength of the urban cantons grew, making them important sources of credit and encouraging the rise of banking .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Some of these changes helped define Switzerland as a lucky region in a violent continent; others made life harder for most Swiss men and women as the period went on. Reduced by the great epidemics of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the population expanded steadily until about 1600, despite occasional setbacks. After that, a less favourable climate and the disruptions of warfare slowed growth of both population and the economy. Still, Switzerland was one of the few regions in Europe to benefit from war after 1500: by avoiding warfare themselves while selling military services, Swiss cities and military entrepreneurs accumulated capital and brought prosperity to elites and moderate taxes for their subjects. The fragmented political system also made it easier for rural manufacturing to spread, challenging the traditional urban domination of the skilled crafts.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By the late sixteenth century, signs of increased pressure and shrinking opportunities became common. With few exceptions, urban manufacturing declined in importance, while a rising population closed off opportunities for social ascent that had existed earlier. As a result, migration (seasonal and permanent) increased, while the underprivileged non-citizen population of cities and in the country became more numerous and more impoverished. Changes in landholding patterns and family structure reinforced social differences at the village level, changing relations not only between the rich and poor, but also between men and women , elder and younger children, and those with or without access to patronage. These trends accelerated when a deteriorating climate, especially in the 1570s and 1650s, brought about repeated agrarian crises. The worst years were 1571/2, when midland lakes froze owing to extreme cold in the winter, and 1587/8, <a id="page_99" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>when snow fell in the midlands well into the summer. A larger population and more frequent crop failures reinforced the advantages of landlords and employers over peasants and labourers, and stimulated the use of credit by peasants and townspeople.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Some half-million people inhabited the territory of modern Switzerland in 1500, not counting the densely populated Italian valleys of the Valtellina and Val d’Aosta. A few rural regions had surprisingly dense population s, such as Appenzell . By 1600, this had increased to about 900,000, with the midlands growing faster than the Alpine regions. Growth slowed sharply from 1600 to 1650, but returned for the remainder of the seventeenth century, leading to a total population of about 1.2 million by 1700, by which time only one-third of the population lived in the Alps. The population data confirms the picture of slow change and vulnerability to crises caused by epidemics and poor weather.</p>
<p class="calibre4">One sign that rural population was beginning to exceed the demands of agrarian labour was the ready availability of young men for mercenary service. At the end of the sixteenth century, some 50,000 Swiss men may have served in foreign regiments, or 5 per cent of the total population. Many did not return. Emigration took other forms, too, corresponding both to the supply and skills of Swiss men and women, and to labour demand in neighbouring regions. Much emigration was seasonal, such as harvest workers, though such work left few records. Where emigrants had specific skills, like the families of artists from the Ticino who established dynasties in Italy, prospects were brighter. The Serodine family, for example, craftsmen and painters from Ascona, found employment in Rome and elsewhere in Italy. Other Ticinese craftsmen practised the craft of stucco sculpture as far away as Hungary and Spain.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1286"><img src="../images/00026.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">3.7 </span>Town of St Gallen with linen bleaching fields. North-eastern Switzerland was an early outpost of large-scale textile production in Switzerland. Already in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, flax grown in Appenzell or around Lake Constance was turned into quality linen cloth on an industrial scale. The spread of proto-industry in the seventeenth century moved more production out to rural areas with low labour costs, which ultimately undermined towns’ monopoly on craft production.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Like the rural economy, the economy of the Swiss cities changed only incrementally during the sixteenth century. By 1500, most of the textile manufacturing that had brought prosperity to medieval Zurich , Fribourg and other cities had declined, with the exception of the St Gallen linen industry. The trans-European fairs that drove Geneva ’s growth before 1500 shifted to Lyons, leaving a diminished city. Local and regional markets brought some business, and the growing revenue from pensions and mercenary operations kept most city treasuries in balance, but the sixteenth century saw few <a id="page_100" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>new manufactures. The major exception was printing , which attracted skilled personnel: Basle became an international printing centre, while smaller shops appeared in Zurich and Geneva. On the whole, though, the political functions of the cities supported their economies: as the site where taxes were gathered, officers appointed and policies negotiated, and as the seat of wealthy families, the cities gained economic advantage through their political centrality.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the seventeenth century, a new phenomenon spread: manufacture of lower-quality goods, mostly textiles , in the countryside though the putting-out system . In many cases, urban entrepreneurs provided raw materials and basic tools to poorer peasant households, who had <a id="page_101" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> surplus labour after they tended their often modest fields and gardens. The products of their farming subsidized their wage labour, making such manufacturing profitable, even as the meagre wages they earned enabled families to survive on smaller plots of land. By allowing more families to form, rural manufacturing also led to a higher birth rate, which drove down the cost of labour further and increased the gap between landed peasants and rural labourers. This system, sometimes called proto-industrialization, built on predecessors such as the St Gallen linen trade , which also combined rural and urban labour, and spread steadily across the midlands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Commercialized cheese production for distant markets also took off. The Alpine regions had switched to cattle-raising in the late Middle Ages, but in the seventeenth century, specialized cheese-producers appeared in the pre-Alps and midlands. Such ‘brands’ as Emmentaler and Gruyère cheese emerged for export to European cities. Producing cheese on an industrial basis required substantial capital, and was promoted by a small number of successful entrepreneurs who owned substantial herds and meadows, and who bought milk from many farmers. The cheese trade further commercialized the countryside through cash purchases and wages, while concentrating wealth in fewer hands. A few new specialized urban manufactures emerged, as well. In Geneva, for example, Huguenot refugees brought both the capital and expertise to launch a silk industry in the 1580s and 1590s.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The economy of the region diverged from its neighbours from 1500 to 1700 in a few significant ways. The key difference was fiscal: because the cantons and Associate s did not bear the enormous costs of warfare , modest economic growth generated new capital in public and private hands. Instead of paying for troops and fortifications, the cantons drew in pension s from French, Spanish, Austrian and Venetian agents. Low costs and outside income allowed the Swiss cities to end the wealth taxes they had previously levied, since consumption taxes on markets and dues from their rural subjects provided enough revenue to grow urban treasuries. The cities thus became sources of credit both within and outside the Confederacy. Basle operated a very successful public bank , and Geneva began developing private banking toward the end of the sixteenth century, often in connection with Huguenot refugees from France. The <a id="page_102" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>accumulation of capital in public and private hands created a pool for further investments that became crucial when rural industrialization took off after 1700.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Slow change in the Swiss economy affected social relations as well. Perhaps the most important was the economic closure of communities of all kinds to new members, in parallel to the political closing of councils and citizenship. In a society for which membership in a commune was a central marker of identity , this closure was of great importance. The phenomenon is most visible in the cities, where a shrinking group of families, the <span class="italic">Ratsfähige</span>, monopolized political life and economic opportunities. In Lucerne , members of some forty-eight families sat in the council between 1510 and 1520, but of only thirty between 1590 and 1600. In the fifteenth century, new families had found it easy to move into urban councils and guild s as they gained in wealth, but after 1500, this flow came to a nearly complete halt. The fees charged to new citizens rose rapidly, especially after the 1550s, and the number of new full citizens dropped sharply. The result was what some historians call ‘aristo-democracy ’, while others call it oligarchy .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Spurred in part by the Reformation , the period after 1500 also brought about important changes in marriage, the most important formal relationship linking women and men, for Catholics as well as Protestants. These changes did not end the legal advantages that men enjoyed – indeed, these tended to intensify during the sixteenth century – but they did transform how gender relations were represented and understood. Zwinglians rejected the Catholic conception of marriage as a sacrament, and denied church courts jurisdiction over marriages, adultery and fornication. Instead, the evangelical cities established civil courts to regulate both marriages and morals. These allowed separations or even divorce in a few cases, but refused to recognize marriages made by couples themselves, demanding instead that parents and pastors give permission. Catholic and Reformed authorities alike sought to discipline individual behaviour and encourage sexual and social propriety by limiting carnivals, festivals and lavish wedding feasts in the name of spiritual values.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fear of female power also increased across Europe in this period, and contributed to more frequent prosecution of people – mostly rural <a id="page_103" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>women – for practising evil magic. Some of the earliest prosecutions of this kind took place in the western Alps, including the Valais and the diocese of Lausanne, in the fifteenth century. Witches were prosecuted in many parts of Switzerland for harmful magic (<span class="italic">maleficia</span>) in the early sixteenth century, often in connection with local quarrels involving sickly infants or hail damage in the fields. The pattern of witch hunting in Switzerland changed sharply after 1550 as magistrates inspired by the notorious <span class="italic">Malleus Maleficarum</span> carried out more prosecutions for Devil-worship. The latest evidence counts over 1700 trials in the Vaud, and at least 1,000 trials in the Grisons between 1580 and 1655, the peak years of the witch craze. Where magistrates had firmer control, witch trials were much less common: in the same period, only eighty persons were prosecuted in Zurich ’s territory. Still, the rural areas of Switzerland continued to see occasional prosecutions for witchcraft long after governments elsewhere had abandoned the ‘crime’ entirely, enabled by Switzerland’s loose structure and social conservatism.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After the crises of the 1520s and the spread of the Protestant Reformation, Switzerland settled into a pattern of local contention but overall caution and conservatism. In the war-torn early modern period, this stance served the Swiss well, leaving them more prosperous and more peaceful than their neighbours, and reinforcing their sense of distinctiveness. Change slowed further after 1656, and became less visible: the institutions of the Confederacy, for all their complexity, seemed permanent and unchangeable. Managed by a patriarchal and increasingly patrician elite, these institutions still left room for a prosperous class of burghers and for a stable peasantry , though one that was vulnerable and increasingly included many impoverished day-labourers.
