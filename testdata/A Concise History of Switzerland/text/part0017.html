<p class="noindent">Immediately after 1848, the new Switzerland seemed to pose a great threat to Metternich and other conservative statesmen. They were alarmed by Switzerland’s propensity to offer asylum, and sometimes support, to opponents of monarchy, and saw it as ‘a revolutionary turntable’ intimately linked to events elsewhere in Europe . Reality was somewhat different because, although the Radicals dominated the new Swiss state , they were less extreme and proceeded more cautiously than the continental powers expected in starting to forge a new, democratic and restrained nation. Their moderation was aided by the willingness of the internal opposition to use the newly created democratic processes, which came to define Switzerland. In the 1860s, however, a new democratic dynamic within the cantons ultimately led to a revised and more centralized constitution . This allowed the country to cope with the social and religious difficulties that emerged as it encountered economic depression . In fact, both state and the party system in Switzerland were able to develop considerably before, around the end of the century, a new conservative turn took place which helped both to consolidate and to redirect the developing national identity that had emerged in parallel with 1848’s state-building. The leaders of the new state were able to forge a new nation based on political will and the key institutions of direct democracy , federalism and neutrality .</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-2172"><span class="title">Establishing the New State</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Though the Sonderbund War led to the creation of a state, the constitution really provided only its outline. It remained to fill this out <a id="page_163" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>domestically with implementing legislation and to ensure that doubters were kept on board. Externally, Switzerland’s new situation meant standing up to the doubting neighbouring powers and devising a more positive neutral role. Immediately after 1847, these tasks fell to the <a id="page_164" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Radicals – the party which had most strongly opposed the Sonderbund and which monopolized the new government and Parliament. This enabled them to activate the new constitution and establish a limited but functioning state. Radical dominance began when the outgoing Diet appointed seven Radicals to make up the new government, led by Jonas Furrer, the leader of anti-liberal forces in Zurich and one of the architects of the new constitution. Thanks to a certain amount of gerrymandering, the movement also held 95 of the 111 seats in the National Council and 38 of the 44 seats in the <span class="italic">Ständerat</span> . The remaining seats were held by conservative Catholics, led by Philip Segesser of Lucerne, a journalist and cantonal administrator who became one of the dominant figures of the Swiss Catholic world.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-2181"><img src="../images/00038.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">6.1 </span>The first Swiss Federal Council, elected on 16 November 1848. One of many such presentations, this shows: top: Wilhelm Matthias Naeff (St Gallen); middle (from left to right) Ulrich Ochsenbein (Berne); Josef Furrer (Zurich); Henri Druey (Vaud); and bottom: Martin Josef Munzinger (Solothurn); Stefano Franscini (Ticino); and Friedrich Frey-Herosé (Aargau). The relatively modest positioning of Furrer, the first President, emphasizes the collegial nature of the government.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Yet the Radicals were actually more of a family, or a movement like the US ‘Tea Party’, than an integrated force. United by their support of the new unified state, liberal institutions and a free economy, they were divided by personalities, region and ideological leanings. On the right were free traders led by Alfred Escher of <a id="page_165" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Zurich, in the centre French-speaking federalists and moderates like Ochsenbein , who lost his place on the Federal Council to fellow Bernese Jakob Stämpfli in 1854. The latter represented the left wing of the movement, along with the <span class="italic">Neue Zürcher Zeitung</span> and politicians like Druey , who wished both to develop a state railway system and to support liberation movements in other countries. For Druey, there could be no neutrality in the struggle between princes and peoples. However, Escher was able to build up a following of nearly fifty MPs, often nicknamed the <span class="italic">Bundesbarone</span> (‘Federal Barons’) because of their influence, who blunted the left’s influence. Given that most of the new MPs came either from the entrepreneurial classes or from the ranks of cantonal magistrates, and often held their seats for long periods, the Federal parliament ultimately imposed cautious rather than extreme governance on the country.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because of such growing restraint, no real purge of Sonderbund supporters took place. Rather, by taking measures against the Jesuits and a few Sonderbund leaders, the new government gave the impression that the war had been a plot by outsiders in which the Catholic population at large was not involved. Given this attempt at conciliation, Catholic opposition to the new order was rarely violent, save in Fribourg and Ticino , where the federal government quashed elections and helped the Radicals hold on to power. Catholics either pragmatically took part in the new order or retreated into a politically inert ghetto, defending their position by the establishment of bodies like the Piusverein of 1857. They showed little desire to undo the verdict of 1847–8 or to plot with foreign powers against the new regime. Their leaders also faced pressure to use ‘national’ rhetoric, even though the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3743"><span class="italic">Urschweiz</span></a></span> cantons stayed out of celebrations such as the 500th anniversary of Zurich ’s entry into the Confederation in 1857. Nevertheless, conservatives of all kinds had to accept the modernization of the cantons, notably in the Grisons , where the principle of communal autonomy expressed through leagues was suppressed, because it was felt too illiberal and old-fashioned for the new government. Similarly, in Schwyz and Zug the Landsgemeinden were abolished.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The new government proceeded carefully in dealing with the frequent cantonal refusals to follow new rules, sending in commissioners and threatening to withdraw subsidies. Moreover, although it devoted much energy to building the new state’s institutions, it held <a id="page_166" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>back from developing an education al and cultural policy, which could have forced Catholic conservatives into outright opposition. In any case, conservative forces came back into power in the early 1850s, notably in Berne and Fribourg. In the latter canton, armed risings against the carpetbagger regime paved the way for its electoral defeat in December 1856. By then the conservatives had also strengthened their position in Geneva, Ticino and Valais . All this made it harder, as well as unwise, for the new government to resort to extreme policies.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hence, as part of a policy of limited centralization, the new government left the cantons with considerable revenues, although it was now able to draw on customs levies to fund its activities. Importantly, the new state issued its own currency. By 1852 the 65 million or so coins then circulating, issued by up to eighty authorities, had been withdrawn and replaced by a new franc , of equivalent value to the French franc and not to the South German guilder, as some had wanted. The government also took over border security, gunpowder, and posts and telegraphs, together with weights and measures. The Constitution also allowed for the creation of a national university , but linguistic fears and cantonal rivalries blocked any progress: only a polytechnic was created in Zurich. An even more important function was national defence. In May 1850, a new law set up a three-tier militia , based on the universal male obligation to serve in cantonal contingents. The army was the Federation’s major expense.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Conversely, railway development, after a bitter debate that focused on what the role of the state should be, was very largely left to private interests. This reflected both the cantons’ desire not to increase central authority, and the power of Escher and his faction, which felt that a state railway , as envisioned by Stämpfli and Druey , would be socialistic and un-republican. However, the policy slowed economic development and led to financial difficulties, despite the establishment in 1856 of the Credit Suisse bank in Zurich, which was set up to counter the arrival there of German banks and to finance the building of new lines. The bank eventually made Zurich, rather than Basle, the richest city in Switzerland. Rivalry between the two cities was reflected in a major conflict between Escher’s North-eastern Railway and the Basle-based Central Railway.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nonetheless, the new state successfully revived economic growth by eliminating tolls and other barriers to trade , as well as bringing in <a id="page_167" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>free establishment for business enterprises so as to create a real internal market for goods and labour. It also signed Switzerland’s first free trade treaties , including with Britain, an important step since the domestic market remained small. The government encouraged industrialization, including experiments in water power and in the food sector, where the first condensed milk factory opened at Cham in Zug in 1866, a year before the predecessor of the Nestlé corporation was founded. Industry proved able to absorb both natural population growth and peasants left behind as agriculture was restructured around dairying, livestock and wine, all of which were less labour intensive than cereals. As a result, emigration did not greatly increase, although urbanization did. These economic changes had significant social implications, with the first trade unions emerging in the late 1850s. The foundation of the Alpine Club in 1857 also demonstrated the increasing importance of mountaineering and tourism.</p>
<p class="calibre4">External events also imposed further caution on the new government, because the great powers still saw Switzerland as a revolutionary state, which was understandable, given the way many Swiss sympathized with various national liberation movements. Indeed, the country provided a base for German revolutionaries’ raids on the Grand Duchy of Baden , and for Ticinese involvement in the Italian war of 1849. In 1852 the expulsion of Capuchins from the canton led to a very damaging blockade and the expulsion of 6,000 Ticinese who were working in Lombardy . Nonetheless, although the country accepted some 9,000 foreign refugees, the government, encouraged by Escher’s faction, sought to maintain a policy of neutrality .</p>
<p class="calibre4">This proved most difficult to sustain in 1856, when republican forces ejected a group of pro-Prussia n royalists who had seized the citadel in Neuchâtel city in an attempt to return the principality to full Prussian rule. Prussia mobilized 160,000 men on the Rhine and threatened to overrun Switzerland in response. But the Swiss government refused to yield, even though its forces were outnumbered more than five to one. Its resistance bought time for Napoleon III to negotiate a settlement in which the King of Prussia gave up his claims, allowing Neuchâtel to become a full Swiss canton. At the same time, the government signed a treaty of friendship with the United Kingdom , which provided support for Swiss independence and neutrality .</p>

<a id="page_168" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_169" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Neutrality came into play again in 1859–60, when the government prevented radical elements from invading Savoy to take advantage of France’s preoccupation with its war with Austria over Italian independence. The government also refused Napoleon III’s subsequent offer to sell Chablais and Faucigny to Switzerland. The government feared both the cost and the effects on the religious balance of incorporating large numbers of Catholics. Likewise, the government refused to accept Stämpfli’s idea of invading Savoy to stop it from falling into French hands. However, it did secure the creation of customs-free zones round Geneva and a satisfactory division of the disputed Valley of Dappes in the Jura. To underline Swiss neutrality, the last remaining mercenary regiments, in Italy, were formally disbanded, leaving only the Vatican Guard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Swiss caution in the 1850s paved the way for the country to adopt a new role as <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3724">Helvetia Mediatrix</a></span> in the 1860s. An important step was taking over control of the infant Red Cross, in which Dufour played a large part along with Henri Dunant. The offer of mediation became a tool of Swiss foreign policy, which encouraged other powers to take Swiss neutrality more seriously. This they did after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1, when the Swiss provided good offices for some German states and sent welfare relief to besieged Strasbourg. More significantly, Swiss forces were responsible for disarming and interning the 87,000 men of Bourbaki’s French Army of the East after its harrowing retreat through the Jura hills into Switzerland. Increasingly the country came to be seen as an unthreatening haven that also provided services in the interest of Europe, such mediating between Great Britain and the United States during the 1872 negotiations over the damage caused by the Confederate privateer <span class="italic">Alabama</span>, which had been illegally fitted out in Birkenhead. By this time foreign fears about the threat from Switzerland had largely dissipated, which further strengthened the position of the new state.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-2254"><span class="title">Democratization and Constitutional Reform</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">This was fortunate, because the 1860s also saw a new surge of popular activism at home, leading to democratization and constitutional <a id="page_170" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>reform first at cantonal level and then nationally, with constitutional revision leading to the transformation of Switzerland into a developed federation . Such developments might have caused international alarm, especially as they involved new friction with the Catholic authorities and community, but by then the country had proved it was no threat to Europe. However, from the 1860s the government’s cautious strategy faced domestic challenges, because it was at odds with the more militant democratic aspirations unleashed in the 1840s. Many supporters of change objected to the arrogant rule of the Radical <span class="italic">Bundesbarone</span> and started campaigning against them, demanding more participation and real control of cantonal governments and parliaments. They also resented the continuing economic disadvantages suffered by outside districts , which were responsible for spurring emigration in the 1850s. These forces turned to direct democracy as their weapon, building on a programme launched in the 1850s by a Zurich journalist and enthusiast for cooperatives, J. J. Treichler . Zurich introduced the legislative initiative , and Neuchâtel the financial referendum, which required a popular vote before any large capital expenditure. Under democratic pressure, Schwyz also did away with the remaining discrimination against the external districts.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The democratic movement really boiled over in the 1860s, starting with opposition to Berne’s railway policy and to Fazy ’s autocratic rule in Geneva. However, the real pathfinder was the new half-canton of Basle Country. There, a Liestal teacher called Christoph Rolle led a fierce campaign for a constituent assembly to draft a new democratic constitution, something which, after some complications, was achieved. The new cantonal constitution subjected all legislation to an obligatory popular challenge , and allowed 1,500 citizens to propose new legislation. Direct election (and recall) of executives and judiciary was also introduced. From Basle, the movement spread to Aargau, Berne, Lucerne, Solothurn and most significantly to Escher’s fief in Zurich, where a Winterthur-based movement to bolster parliamentary governance by direct democracy got under way. After a series of mass meetings, revision was agreed in December 1867, and a new constitution came into effect in 1869. It introduced legislative and constitutional initiatives , obligatory <a id="page_171" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> referenda on all major expenditures, a reduction of Grand Council powers and the direct election of the government. A cantonal bank and progressive tax ation were also established. Politically this meant the end of Escher ’s influence, not just in Zurich but also in the country at large.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The democratic trend continued to spread beyond Zurich, and progressive constitutional reforms were pushed through in several more cantons. Such local reforms enabled the cantons to develop a new dynamism that helped to balance the overall trend towards centralization in the later nineteenth century. Moreover, the first calls for political rights for women were heard, leading to the establishment of an International Women’s Movement in Geneva. The social pressures behind the movement also spurred important social legislation during the 1860s, with a Seventy-Two Hours Act and a Factory Act in Glarus forced through by the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3728">Landsgemeinde</a></span> , and similar legislation in other cantons. Cantonal banks were also widely established, crafts given freedom from guild regulation, bankruptcy laws changed and indirect taxes whittled away, moves which helped hard-pressed craftsmen, peasants, shopkeepers and minor professionals. In 1864, trade unions were legalized nationally, followed by strikes the next year.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although no single new democratic party emerged, the process did have an impact at the federal level. The issue of popular rights gained resonance through Protestant and liberal responses to the 1864 papal ‘Syllabus of Errors’, which condemned most modern ideas out of hand. In response, the Bernese administration introduced new restrictions on Catholic organization in the Jura district. Catholic feelings were also aroused by an 1864 trade treaty with France that gave French Jews more rights than those enjoyed by Swiss Jews. A constitutional amendment was needed to remedy the discrimination and give all Swiss citizens full rights of establishment anywhere in the country, though this offended a latent strain of anti-Semitism in Swiss society. The amendment on free movement was linked to several other suggested constitutional revisions, including on freedom of belief. But only the new equality provision and an endorsement of the metric system were accepted, showing that despite democratization – or because of it – Swiss voters remained doubtful about change.</p>
<a id="page_172" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Popular resistance to new measures became very clear in the early 1870s, after the experiences of war had shown the country’s military organization to be ill suited to a long mobilization because of its dependence on cantonal contingents. Led by Emil Welti , an Aargau Radical and from 1867 the party’s dominating personality, the Federal Council decided to include army reform – replacing cantonal contingents by central control and provision – in a larger programme of constitutional reform, described as ‘one law, one army’. The initiative involved fifty mainly centralizing changes to laws that had been poorly handled in 1848, new policy powers for the centre, including over marriage, and wider political rights. These included the introduction both of a popular legislative challenge by 50,000 voters, plus legislative initiative and repeal. Overall, the constitutional revision offered a pithier document that was less concerned with canton al rights than its predecessor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Such changes were too much for many. One moderate federal councillor, Jakob Dubs , who had been the government’s leading light before Welti had been elected in 1867, resigned to fight the changes. Another, Jean-Jacques Challet-Vernet, was later voted out in favour of a known supporter of the changes. Radical opponents of revision were able to draw on Catholic opposition, led by Segesser , to changes in marriage and church laws, and in cantonal rights. Traditional liberals were also unhappy about centralization and the effects of legal and military unification. Suisse Romande cantons feared that in a closer federation , French-speakers would be dominated by the German-speaking cantons , marking the emergence of language as a salient political divide for the first time since the expansion of the Confederation after 1799 had brought in non-German-speaking cantons. Over the next hundred years and beyond the language issue was to become increasingly important. In the plebiscite of May 1872, hostile votes in Geneva, Vaud and the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3743">Urschweiz</a></span> were particularly significant in the narrow defeat of the package by 260,000 votes (13 cantons) to 256,000 (9 cantons).</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-2306"><img src="../images/00040.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">6.2 </span>One of several souvenir lithographs celebrating the successful reform of the Federal Constitution in 1874. Flanked by the shields of the cantons it shows Helvetia standing on a plinth detailing the acceptances and rejections. The fact that there were nearly 200,000 of the latter, drawn especially from the German-speaking Inner Swiss cantons, points to the continuing difficulties the new republic was to have with Catholic conservative dissidence. However, the poster surrounds Helvetia with reminders of the main achievements of the new Confederation, including unified law; protection for workers and children; free establishment; federal support for marriage and freedom of thought.</div>
<p class="calibre4">However, Welti and the progressive Radicals in government did not give up, and continued to work for constitutional reform, claiming that ‘Revision is dead, long live revision’. They now sought to divide and rule the opposition by responding to French-speaking <a id="page_173" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_174" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>concerns and ignoring those of the Catholics, with whom their relations were declining. As they put it, ‘We need the <span class="italic">Welsche</span>’ (as French -speakers were nicknamed in the east of the country). The package was redesigned by slimming down the legal and military changes and restoring some cantonal rights. The legislative initiative was withdrawn, but the number of signatures needed for a challenge was reduced to 30,000. The draft was also more overtly anti-clerical than its predecessors, banning the creation of new bishoprics and the introduction of religious orders. The Radicals ’ strategy worked, winning over people like Dubs , so that the package was comfortably carried in May 1874 by 340,000 (14½ cantons) to 198,000 (7½). As a result, Switzerland became even more of a more thoroughly federal state , more powerful and legitimate, under a constitution which was to prove surprisingly long-lasting.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The anti-Catholic tone of the new constitution was one aspect of a recrudescence of religious conflict in the early 1870s, a phenomenon known as the <span class="italic">Kulturkampf</span> . Division had its roots in liberal responses to the growing Catholic ultramontanism visible after the First Vatican Council and the 1871 declaration of papal infallibility. Many Catholics were unhappy about these moves, and many Protestants were absolutely horrified. When, in 1872, Bishop Lachat of Basle ignored advice from his colleagues and not only promulgated the decree, but also excommunicated clerics in the Bernese Jura who opposed it, an explosion of anger ripped through non-Catholic Switzerland. After the majority of Jurassian clergy supported the Bishop, the Berne se authorities intervened harshly, using troops to close churches and arrest clergy, who were often replaced by outside clerics. State support also went to a group of dissenting liberal Catholic clerics who seceded and set up a new Christian Catholic Church , which refused to accept the Vatican Decrees. Pope Pius IX added to the conflict by denouncing the <span class="italic">Kulturkampf</span> and appointing, without any consultation, the aggressive ultramontane Gaspard Mermillod as Apostolic Vicar of Geneva. The Federal Coun cil responded by expelling both Mermillod and the papal nuncio and then breaking off diplomatic relations with the Vatican . Moreover, even as the democratic movement and the new constitution revived a latent division, other major problems were also beginning to press in on the country.</p>
<a id="page_175" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><h3 class="sec" id="c19444-2326"><span class="title">An age of Depression and Stress</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The divisive relationship between successive Radical governments and the Catholic Church was in fact considerably complicated by an economic downturn that began in 1873 and led to other destabilizing social divisions. Most notably the crisis promoted trade unions and socialism , which became a threat not just to the Radicals but also to Catholics. The latter saw them as a real danger to their beliefs and position, forcing them to draw nearer to the new state. They were helped in this by the fact that they could use the new instruments of direct democracy to block legislation of which they disapproved. As a result they reinforced the country’s emerging sense of identity and unity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the 1860s, the economy had continued to grow and mechanize, notably in cotton , watches and machine tools. In part, growth fed on the railway boom, even though many lines remained in debt. The upward cycle also helped to produce new financial institutions like Swiss Reinsurance Company in 1863 and the Swiss People’s Bank in 1869. At the same time, the tourist industry expanded: Thomas Cook organized his first tour in 1863, the same year as Edward Whymper’s dramatic ascent of the Matterhorn . In the following years, winter sports began to take off, encouraged in part by rail travel and Leslie Stephens’s 1871 book <span class="italic">The Playground of Europe</span>.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Agriculture had long seen the slowest growth of all three sectors, and was to prove the weak link after 1873, when a flood of grain and meat from North America and Eastern Europe poured into Western Europe , thanks to railways and refrigerated ships. Small farms could not compete, even when helped by cantonal banks , and many farmers began to leave the land – whether for the cities or for places like Argentina, Australia and especially the United States – leaving mountain areas like Ticino virtually depopulated. The new wave of emigration peaked between 1880 and 1885, and particularly hit the number of speakers of Rhaeto-Romansh , which began to decline despite the growth of medical and sporting tourism to the Grisons . The agricultural labour force fell rapidly, especially in the 1870s and 1880s. By the deepest point of the depression in 1888, there were more people working in manufacture s than on farms. Switzerland was one of only six European countries in which farming was not the dominant sector. Overall the agrarian labour force halved between <a id="page_176" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> 1850 and 1910, despite the beginnings of a modern food industry with the foundation of Maggi in 1872.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Other sectors suffered from the depression as well. In fact, the 1876 World Fair revealed how far the Swiss watch industry had lagged behind automated American production. While the industry rapidly modernized, this was not the case for textiles , which suffered badly and lost a third of its labour force. Glarus cotton and St Gallen embroideries were particularly hit. Conversely, metallurgy and chemicals (which had developed out of textile dying) did well. Brown Boveri , the largest Swiss engineering firm, dates from 1884, and Sandoz followed two years later. Increasingly, production became factory based, especially in German-speaking Switzerland: the Bally shoe factory in Solothurn is a notable example. Hydroelectric power and other forms of electricity began to spread after 1879, and two years later the first phone lines were installed. Urbanization and commercialization encouraged retail services, with the first big department stores such as Jelmoli coming in the 1880s, often opening new employment prospects for women . Banking modernized, with concentration and a move away from simple local banks to cantonal and even bigger banks with a much wider remit. Economic pressure also encouraged the emergence of Raiffeisen savings banks for small savers after 1880.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The changing structure and fortunes of Swiss industry in this period had both social and political effects. Workers were often restive, and looked for protection. This encouraged new forms of trade unionism , leading to the establishment of the Schweizerischer Gewerkschaftsbund /Union Syndicale Suisse, the umbrella organization in the early 1880s, although it at first accounted for only some 9 per cent of the workforce. Strikes also became more common, notably with Zurich locksmiths in 1886. In the next decade, works committees emerged, along with the first all-female trade unions. Workers’ representatives began to call on the government for action on unemployment and other social issues. Not only was a Social Democratic Party (SPS) established in 1888, but two years later it got its first MP in the person of the veteran J. J. Treichler, who by then had become an ultra-leftist. The movement, though still small, was stronger and more united in German-speaking cantons than in the Suisse Romande , where socialist parties were more strictly cantonal. <a id="page_177" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>At the same time, May Day emerged as a workers’ festival, and the left began to organize its first referendum challenges. Such widely based worker participation in the new national democratic processes added a new element to Swiss politics. In contrast, a Zurich-based petition of 1886 for female suffrage led nowhere.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The way in which socialism developed in Switzerland had significant consequences both for the Swiss state and for political Catholicism. The Radical regime, still led by Welti , had to decide how to respond to the rise of a workers’ movement, given that the party still saw itself as the representative of all Swiss people (and needed to keep workers’ votes). It began by passing a Factory Act , enshrining an eleven-hour day, in 1877; ten years later, it set up a Workers’ Secretariat as a means of balancing the combined influence of the employers’ organization, the Vorort , set up in 1870, and the 1879 Gewerbeverband /USAM, the representative organization for small business and crafts.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The rise of socialism alarmed many Catholics, because, following the Syllabus of Errors, they saw it as atheistic and subversive. But combating it required new tactics. A new generation of leaders realized that they could not simply rely on <span class="italic">ex cathedra</span> condemnations, especially in light of <span class="italic">Kulturkampf</span> suspicion of the Papacy. Catholicism needed new allies and more political influence, which meant taking a more active and collaborative part in mainstream Swiss politics. The path to such engagement was eased by the accession of Leo XIII, who helped wind down the Swiss <span class="italic">Kulturkampf</span> by withdrawing Mermillod’s status as Apostolic Vicar and transferring Lachat to Ticino. In response, the persecution of priests began to ease, and many were allowed to return to their posts.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the political front, the Catholic conservatives failed to gain a seat on the Federal Council in 1875 for Josef Zemp, a leading parliamentarian from Lucerne, but they were more successful in using the new rights of challenge to block legislation of which they disapproved. Although their effort to obstruct the 1877 Factory Act failed, in 1882 they were successful in blocking the proposal to create School Inspectors, whom they nicknamed ‘Bailiffs’ (<span class="italic">Vögte</span>) as if they were latter-day Gesslers . Such inspectors would, of course, have undermined the Church’s position in education . Proposals for military taxation, patent reform, labour conditions and constitutional revision were also rejected. Indeed, in May 1884, all four <a id="page_178" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>government proposals up for public vote were defeated. This made people aware of the strength of political Catholicism .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Zemp and others also sought to create a national party, as with the Conservative Union of 1881–2, but they were continually blocked by Segesser and the so-called ‘Landammänner’ or leaders of the old Alpine Catholic cantons . Nonetheless, in 1884 Zemp and his associates issued a manifesto calling on Catholics to take a more constructive role in national politics, coupled with proposals for quite dramatic changes in the constitution. Increasingly the interests of Catholics in non-Catholic cantons, the so-called diaspora, came to the fore. For younger Catholics working in places like Basle, restricting themselves to living in a ghetto and refusing to engage with mainstream Swiss life was not possible. They thus warmed to Zemp’s programme of social and federalist change, especially as it was coupled with defence of the Church under the slogan of ‘a free church in a free state’. They were also willing to cooperate with Protestant Conservatives where necessary in another move towards integrating into the national mainstream. Catholics also began to set up their own trade unions. However, the tradition of cantonal particularism and the reality of language divisions were hard to overcome. A joint Catholic agenda did not emerge until the end of the 1880s, when the first university to operate in a Catholic canton was founded in Fribourg. The Encyclical <span class="italic">De Rerum Novarum</span> of 1891 reduced tension further, though the Christian Catholic Church did not return to Roman obedience.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Both the rise of the left and the way that the Catholics used the new system to their advantage caused real problems for the Radicals , especially after they suffered an electoral check in 1878. Increasingly, they were divided both over the attitude to adopt to the left and by language, since French-speakers tended to distance themselves from many Radical projects, notably the constitutional reform of 1872. Reorganization became essential: in 1878, led by Emil Frey , a Basle journalist and former Union prisoner in the South during the American Civil War, the Radicals created their first parliamentary group to develop unity and cohesion. Building on moves in German-speaking Switzerland in the late 1870s, Frey also unsuccessfully called for the creation of a proper party. In 1881 the Radical government, where Emil Welti was still influential, moved to bring the Suisse <a id="page_179" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Romande back on board after its post-1872 coolness by finally persuading Louis Ruchonnet , the leading Vaudois federalist Radical of his day, to join the Federal Council in preference to Segesser . Conversely, the government’s attempt to move to the left and bring socialists back under the Radicals’ old patriotic and progressive umbrella was resisted by the Radical Right, the so-called Centre, which controlled government until the late 1880s, when the Zurich democrat Walter Hauser was elected. This opened the way to the election of Frey to the Federal Council in 1890. By then, moreover, the effects of the depression and the socio-political stresses it had helped to produce were beginning to wane, opening the way to new developments in state - and nation-building.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-2399"><span class="title">State and Party development</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Even before this, in fact, the Radical state had begun to change as a result of the 1874 constitutional reform. Conflict with Catholics and the left encouraged the introduction of proportional representation at cantonal level, which in turn forced the state to take on new tasks and the country’s main political forces to organize as parties . The 1880s thus saw a new wave of state modernization, including the development of new direct democratic instruments and a more pluralist party structure. At home, the Radical government promoted national citizenship, began to spend more on primary education and the army, and embarked on new policy areas such as forestry. It even began to consider welfare provision. Externally, because of the depression, it moved away from free trade to moderate protectionism in the mid-1880s. It also became more combative in its trade policy, demanding the opening of other markets in return for access to Switzerland’s. These trends were very apparent in a clutch of new trade treaties with neighbouring states at the end of the 1880s. As well as being more activist, the government sought to become more efficient and specialized. Hence Numa Droz , a Radical journalist from Neuchâtel and the youngest Federal Councillor ever when he was elected at the age of 32 in 1875, was able to end the tradition of letting the headship of the Political (or Foreign) Department rotate with the presidency of the Council. He held the position for several years, becoming the first proper Swiss foreign minister. Nonetheless, some ministers still found <a id="page_180" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> the burden of the presidency of the new-style state a real challenge. Indeed, on Christmas Day 1880, Fridolin Anderwert from Thurgau killed himself because of press criticism and his fear of becoming president. Nevertheless, the Confederation was moving further down the road to being a true federal state. As a result, the cantons began to count for rather less in foreign affairs, and in 1894 the idea of giving them all customs revenues was rejected at a votation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Diplomatically, the country was increasingly accepted as a permanent neutra l whose revolutionary days were far behind it. In consequence, the International Postal Union and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures were given Swiss homes in 1874–5. Many Swiss still felt that outside conflicts were putting the country increasingly under threat, given French resentments over 1871, the way united Italy was flexing its muscles and especially the growing power of Germany. In 1889 the government had to expel Wohlgemuth, one of Bismarck’s agents sent to spy on German socialists in exile. Such fears encouraged military changes, including a Defence Committee, new weapons and a lasting reorganization of the infantry into four corps. Nevertheless, the electorate remained reluctant to accept a real foreign policy, refusing to fund either an embassy in Washington in 1884 or more legations in 1895. Droz’s experiment with the Political Department was also reversed after his retirement in 1892. Public pressure for tariff protection similarly forced the government to harden its stance in the 1890s, leading to a tariff war with France in 1893–5.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite the conservatism of the Swiss electorate, domestic politics were soon to change dramatically. In 1890 Ticin ese Radicals staged the last putsch in Swiss history in response to the unfair way the first-past-the-post system rewarded Catholic conservatives with a large majority, despite their having gained only a few more votes than the Radicals . The Confederation had to intervene militarily. To avoid any further conflict, it then imposed proportional representation (PR) on the canton. PR had been talked about since the 1840s, but came to the fore after it was adopted by Neuchâtel in 1889. Following its imposition on Ticino, Geneva, Zug , Solothurn and Schwyz moved to adopt it for their own elections. By the end of the decade, an initiative demanding the adoption of the system at the national level was launched.</p>
<a id="page_181" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">A national initiative was possible because the public had, in 1891, backed a government proposal to allow initiatives for partial revisions of the Constitution , as well as those proposing a complete overhaul. The change allowed 50,000 citizens to propose a votation on specific, often policy-oriented, alterations to the Constitution . The rash of referenda challenging proposed laws in the 1880s, only a third of which were won by the government, was not felt to be democratic enough, and generated the demand that the people should be able to change the Constitution themselves. What they actually got in 1891 was not formally the legislative initiative found at cantonal level, but a new partial constitutional revision facility that ended up acting in much the same way, since it allowed minorities to put their ideas on the political agenda. The issue did not arouse much public interest at the time, but it was to reshape Swiss politics over the coming decades. As a result of repeated partial revisions, the Constitution became a strange mixture of general principles and highly specific elements.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The new initiative process also forced political movements to organize, since campaigning required effective structures. The Radicals finally united under a single organization led by Emil Frey , who was now the dominant figure in the Federal Council , and established the Radical Democratic Party. He and others realized that, threatened as they were on two sides by the Catholics and the emerging socialists , the Radicals could no longer afford either indiscipline or overt objections to democratic votes. They also needed allies: when Emil Welti retired from government after the electorate refused to accept his advice and endorse the state’s purchase of the Central Railway , Josef Zemp was invited to join the Federal Council , thereby breaking the Radicals’ monopoly. This was only a partial step towards reconciliation with the conservatives, even though Zemp was to prove highly successful in winning support for railway nationalization.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ironically, the divided Catholics found it more difficult to unite than the Radicals. On the one hand, there was friction between Suisse Romande circles and unions , and the German-speaking Association of Men and Workmen’s Societies (VMAV), which wanted to expand westwards. On the other, the socially aware diaspora in the industrializing cities was continually at odds with the old-fashioned conservatives in the Alpine heartland of Catholicism. Even though Catholic MPs, like the leaders of the diaspora, called for an organized party, and <a id="page_182" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>something like a Catholic party emerged after a meeting at Olten in 1894, it was signally ineffective. The pro-Jesui t stance of some of its leaders, moreover, threatened to erect new barriers to Catholic links with Protestant conservatives. Nonetheless, the new opportunities completed the integration of Catholic conservatives into the body politic, and hence into supporting both the new state and Swiss national identity. By the turn of the century the problems of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3739"><span class="italic">Sonderbund</span></a></span> era were largely solved: Catholic conservatives were both represented in government and still able to use democratization against the Radicals. Many Catholics, moreover, were coming to see the liberal state as a valuable protection against the growth of the extreme left. As a result, conservatism in Switzerland began to move in a different direction, more concerned with national and social integrity than with sectarian issues and opposition to the new state. In fact the latter, along with Swiss nationhood, became increasingly accepted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the same time as the left was seeking representation in Parliament, it was also seeking constitutional amendments providing for industrial injury insurance, the nationalization of railways – whose precariousness was shown up by a strike in 1897–8 – and its ‘Right to Work’ proposal. The last was roundly rejected in 1894 by 80 per cent of those voting, thanks to the activity of the peasant s who had established their own lobbies, which cooperated with the Vorort and the USAM to combat the left. Although resistance to female involvement in politics remained fierce, politics did become increasingly pluralist. It also became increasingly national, with further moves towards uniformity in the late 1880s and 1890s: legal unification; civil marriage ; army reform; metrification; state monopoly of bank notes; naturalization; control of inns, patents and water power . However, the state did not expand greatly in size, although a Health Office was set up in 1893 and a fund was created to bail out the railways . The Confederation was also finally allowed to subsidize primary education , continuing the development of both state and party system.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-2455"><span class="title">A Conservative and Industrial Nation</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The years leading up to the First World War saw a mixture of continuity and change. The role of the state continued to evolve in response to the heightened pace of industrialization, while the government <a id="page_183" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>   became protectionist and defensive in reaction to the growing Great Power tensions around Switzerland. This also reflected growing national consciousness and feeling, encouraged by a growing use of histori cal references. The party system became increasingly pluralist, and both government and nation underwent a conservative turn, visible in the emergence of an anti-leftist <span class="italic">Bürgerblock</span> that was to prove a lasting feature of Swiss political history.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The course of the continuous changes reflected the increasingly rapid pace of Swiss economic growth , which followed on the ending of the depression in the early 1890s. A new industrial surge, sometimes seen as a second industrial revolution, emerged as the country moved into electricity , which became a major investment sector with a real domestic market and firms. Chemicals and engineering  also expanded, with companies like Hoffman La Roche emerging in 1<a id="page_184" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>896, while railway mileage doubled between 1880 and 1910. Rail’s value to tourism was increasingly appreciated with the development of mountain railways, such as that to the Hotel Burgenstock in 1888 and, a decade later, with electrification. By 1900, 45 per cent of the working population was employed in manufacturing (including foreign workers), leaving only 31 per cent in agriculture. Owing mostly to tourism, banking and railways, the services’ share of overall employment rose from 16 per cent to 24 per cent. Exports per capita remained very high: Nestlé – which emerged in 1905 – moved into the Japanese market, and textiles and watches sold well abroad, even though the share of textiles in the overall mix fell sharply in the 1890s.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-2470"><img src="../images/00041.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">6.3 </span>A scene from the building of the St Gotthard tunnel. Taken ten years before opening the photograph shows rolling stock being prepared for further boring work. The tunnel allowed the Gotthard railway to provide a service between Lucerne and Chiasso. Linking Ticino to the main body of the Confederation, the tunnel was to be the centrepiece of the developing rail network, which was so important to the late nineteenth-century Swiss economy, society and politics.</div>
<p class="calibre4">As a result, Switzerland became a significant economic power, almost equalling the UK in terms of per capita GDP. Exports and foreign investment per capita also grew, the latter outstripping that of the UK. Economic growth showed in the rapid expansion of towns, and the way they equipped themselves with new facilities like libraries, theatres and schools. The boom also helped to produce a surge in population, which rose on average by 1.2 per cent a year from 1890 to 1913, taking the total to over 3.3 million by 1900 and 3.8 million by 1914. Along with population growth, the contraction of agriculture freed up further labour for the new factories, as did the rapid decline in emigration after 1880. However, there were still jobs to be had, and an increasing number of these were filled by foreigners, notably through immigration from Italy and Germany. Switzerland moved from being a country of emigration to one marked by immigration : by 1900 there were 380,000 outsiders in Switzerland. However, conditions for workers were often difficult, since prices outstripped wages, and workers faced major problems with poor housing, alcoholism and debt. Hence the number of strikes began to increase, enabled in part by the creation of union strike pay funds.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Concerns about growth and social unrest – the ‘social problem’ – led to the first attempts to provide state social welfare through state accident insurance. Although such efforts were supported by workers and some industrialists (who hoped to shift their costs onto the state), the so-called Lex Forrer was successfully challenged in May 1900 by an alliance of private insurance firms, peasants and Catholics. However, the state still changed its economic policy in <a id="page_185" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>other ways. Its protectionism intensified, with much higher tariffs being adopted in 1903. This paved the way for a new series of trade treaties with European states. Economic intervention was also made easier by legal changes in the early 1900s.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The most significant change in the role of the state came with the nationalization of the railways . Despite sustained opposition, changing political attitudes and the rail companies’ growing financial problems won the idea public favour. The door to nationalization was opened in 1897 by a popular votation , and over the next twelve years, the main companies became part of a new Swiss Federal Railways system, set up in 1902. By then the railways were already beginning to electrify their lines. This ‘drift to state socialism by anti-socialists’ further increased the number of state employees. However, the electorate rejected the idea of creating a national bank in 1897, which showed that older more restrained attitudes also persisted. Not until 1905 was this step towards a modern, powerful and centralized state finally approved.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Acceptance of a larger role for the state, and of the taxes to support it, grew towards the end of century as a more cohesive Swiss identity emerged under the umbrella of the new federal state. Intellectuals like the novelist Gottfried Keller had called in the 1870s for national festivals to celebrate national feeling . The spread of primary schooling and literacy, the impact of railways and military service and the development of festivals all helped to develop a wider sense of national identity . In fact, the first National Exhibition, held in Zurich in 1883, attracted 1.7 million visitors. Moreover, awareness of the rising tide of nationalism in neighbouring countries led government and many others to think about how to overcome internal divisions by redefining and maintaining Swiss identity in a more difficult environment. Obviously, such an identity for Switzerland could not rest on linguistic or ethnic foundations. Instead, thinkers such as Carl Hilty emphasized the desire of the Swiss to live together as a so-called <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3746"><span class="italic">Willensnation</span></a></span> . Civic nationalism of this kind emphasized that Switzerland’s historical roots and long adhesion to shared constitutional rules and processes had created a nation, as well as a state, despite the lack of shared language and religion.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-2496"><img src="../images/00042.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">Figure 6.1 </span>The modern Swiss political process</div>
<p class="calibre4">History thus played an increasingly central part in the mix of elements that defined the Swiss, looking beyond the divisive events <a id="page_186" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>of 1798 and 1848 (which were not universally celebrated) to celebrate their longer-term unity. The late nineteenth century saw ever more historical festivals and exhibitions, a boom in historical plays, and the establishment of historical museums in Zurich and Berne. The Swiss-oriented National Library and the iconic Bundeshaus in central Berne were also completed at this time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Academics, meanwhile, were reconstructing the narrative of Swiss history using the rediscovered charter of 1291 and supplanting the traditional date of 1307 associated with William Tell , the oath against Austria and the liberation saga. However, the latter continued to be taught in Swiss schools. A new generation of historian s like Dändliker, Oechsli and Dierauer, whose massive history started to appear in 1887, dismissed the mythical rebellion of 1307 in favour of a long-term voluntaristic narrative of Switzerland’s formation. Oechsli relegated Tell to the realms of myth. This trend was symbolized by the national celebration in 1891, celebrating the 600th anniversary of the supposed foundation of the Confederation, and also by the way that 1 August became the key national holiday celebrated as the Confederacy ’s founding day, now supported by written evidence. This elite approach did not replace the older view, reliant on traditional myths , which remained strongly entrenched at the grass roots, as seen in the 1895 erection of the Tell monument in Altdorf and Hodler ’s 1897 heroic portrait of the hero. A further contribution to the new Swiss identity came from those, like Bluntschli, who looked to geography and landscape. For him, echoing Schiller, the Alps were a symbol of Swiss simplicity, purity, honesty, liberty and virtue. This Alpine myth encouraged calls for defence of the national patrimony, and led to the creation of the first Nationa l Park in the Engadine in 1904 and the establishment of the Swiss League for the Protection of the Homeland , the Heimatschutz, in 1905.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A negative side of such cultural nation-formation appeared in the way many Swiss also began to see their country and their identity as threatened by the presence of a superfluity of foreigners , which was called <span class="italic">Überfremdung</span> or over-foreignization. Such sentiments emerged in 1893 in the vote banning ritual slaughter of animals (which also had anti-Semitic overtones), and after 1900 became a general public concern, shared both by nationally minded Radical MPs and by Social Democrats worried about the loss of industrial <a id="page_187" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>jobs, notably to the growing number of Italians who were coming to work in Switzerland. These fears reflected the fact that Switzerland had seven times the European average of foreign residents: foreigners made up 14.7 per cent of the workforce nationally, a figure rising to 21 per cent in Zurich.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Many immigrants were Germans, who often took up sensitive professional posts, something that worried specialist milieus in the 1890s, despite admiration for imperial Germany in German-speaking Switzerland . Since many Germans came to Switzerland to avoid Bismarck ’s attacks on the Social Democrats, moreover, Swiss nationalists sought to paint foreigners as left-wing threats to the social order. Hence, whereas at the end of the 1890s there had been moves towards integrating immigrants by increasing the rate of naturalization, in the new century resistance to such policies grew. The Federal Council took no action as right-wing forces began to argue that foreigners in themselves constituted a danger. Anti-foreigner riots in Berne and Zurich, often directed against Italian workers, increased tensions, and national identity became more emotional, if not exactly ethnic, as a result.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The intensification of European nationalism based on ethnicity had a Swiss counterpart in the emergence of new linguistic divides. In German-speaking regions, moves to defend the German language emerged, exemplified by Jakob Hunziker’s 1898 work <span class="italic">Kampf um das Deutschtum in der Schweiz</span> (1898) and in 1904 by the establishment of the Deutschsprachverein to promote the German language. When the terms of the 1909 Gotthard Convention with Germany and Italy became known, a vast petitioning movement spread in the Suisse Romande , demanding its abrogation not simply because it gave too much away, but because it represented a virtual German takeover of Switzerland. In the Vaud, signatures were collected for an initiative to subject future treaties to an optional referendum.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Another divide was social. The rise of the socialist movement and the growing number of strikes (over 1800 between 1900 and 1914, including general strikes in Geneva and Lausanne in 1907 and especially Zurich in 1912) caused great alarm amongst employers, middle classes and peasants. In 1907, the army was called in to deal with major strikes , and both Berne and Zurich soon passed no-strike laws. Concern was intensified when the Social Democrats, who had increased their membership greatly in 1901 by a merger with the <a id="page_188" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>long-established Grütli movement, developed municipal socialism and began to win more seats in parliament, gaining fifteen by 1911. The party also began to move to the left, adopting a Marx ist and class-conflict-based programme in 1908.</p>
<p class="calibre4">These developments not only pushed the Radicals away from their earlier ‘all nation’ stance and towards the right; the years before 1914 also saw the formation of a bourgeois laager or <span class="italic">Bürgerblock</span> , a self-contained politico-social camp led by the Vorort , the USAM and the Peasants’ Union, and involving both Radicals and Catholic Conservatives, all of whom believed the nation was in conflict with the left-wing camp. In 1911, this alliance was able to reduce a new law on sickness and accident insurance to a mere skeleton of the original plan. The national Social Insurance Office, established in 1913 to help with unemployment, was also slow to develop owing to middle-class and peasant reservations.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The emerging new-style conservatism was also visible in attitudes towards democratic processes. Thus, despite the adoption of proportional representation in more cantons, including Basle Country, the national electorate three times turned it down between 1905 and 1910, albeit by narrow margins. Apparently Swiss voters, despite their growing divisions, were willing to tolerate the continuance of Radical hegemony. Similarly, in 1900, direct election to the Federal Council was also rejected, while the idea of submitting treaties to popular approval, first raised in 1897, failed to progress despite the impetus given to it by the storm over the Gotthard Convention. Not surprisingly, calls for women’s suffrage – pushed by an Association of Female Workers from 1893 and from 1904 by the Social Democrats – also continued to be ignored, as were demands for female representation on education and health boards. Indeed, the new Civil Code of 1907 was very unhelpful to women .</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Radical Party, although still dominant in Parliament , found itself facing new centrifugal pressures. Between 1896 and 1905, it lost its left wing, which went on to form the Democratic Party. It also lost some more conservative members to a new Liberal Party between 1904 and 1913, while agrarian and evangelical elements were also getting restive. Peasants felt that their debt problems were not being addressed sufficiently and that the party was still too close to the bitterly distrusted socialists. The unease of mainstream Protestants <a id="page_189" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>with the party ultimately led to a secession in 1917 by what later became the Evangelical People’s Party. In fact, despite its developing organizational apparatus, the Radical Party was declining even as it moved into closer alliance with big business. The 1912 General Strike in Zurich accentuated both trends, and also drove the party closer to anti-foreigner forces, including an emerging new right led by the aristocratic right-wing controversialist Gonzague de Reynold , which, echoing the Action Française, sought a return to the Ancien Régime and traditional ‘Helvetianism ’.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Conservative forces could also increasingly rely on Catholic support. Although the 1894 Catholic Party had been stillborn, pressure for Catholic unity continued to grow, encouraged both by the holding of All-Swiss Catholic Days after 1903 and by outside pressures, notably from students, and by fears of atheistic socialism . Despite some resistance from old Catholic oligarchs in Fribourg and elsewhere, a new Catholic Conservative Party was finally established at Lucerne in April 1912, which brought the Swiss Catholics a step further towards full participation in the political system on the bourgeois side.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The growing social divide underlying this was, of course, a reflection of the continuing growth of the Swiss economy. After a brief period of over-heating at the turn of the century, the economy continued to expand. By the outbreak of war in 1914, although the Swiss accounted for only 1 per cent of the European population, they provided 3 per cent of its exports (four-fifths being of manufactured goods) and 5.7 per cent of its capital stock. Switzerland also had more large-scale firms than many other countries. Thriving tourism and commerce brought 22 million overnight stays in hotels, a figure not equalled until after 1945.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The intensification of industrialization brought half a million workers into 8,000 factories, often operated by electricity and sometimes found in mountain regions, thanks to hydroelectricity. Politically, economic growth meant that there was a strong, well-educated and sometimes foreign workforce. The fact that so many workers concentrated in the bigger towns meant that many in the Swiss countryside found industrialization frightening, whether despite or because of the generally decentralized nature of Swiss society. In fact, the major urban population rose from 11.6 per cent in 1900 to 16 per cent by 1914, and <a id="page_190" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>larger towns gained a third of all the new jobs created after 1888. Since agriculture was not expanding, rural fears are easy to understand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For those who ran the new factories and banks, worker militancy became a major concern. Interestingly, the pre-war period brought a boom for banks, with forty-five new foundations and thirty significant mergers. The latter produced both the Basle-based Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) in 1896 and Zurich’s Union Bank (UBS) in 1912, the year the Association of Swiss Bankers was established. These were large-scale, general-purpose banks on the model already pioneered in Germany and France. Swiss banks soon began selling their services to wealthy foreigners, in part by marketing their discretion and secrecy, in response to increasing taxation in France and elsewhere. This helped them to attract business and compete with rivals in bigger states. Bankers were generally very hostile to socialism, deepening the growing political divide.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though Swiss respect for neutrality grew in the years before 1914, external developments added to the growing linguistic division. In 1907, a new Geneva Convention was signed on treatment of combatants at sea, the same year that the second set of Hague Conventions on neutrality and the laws of war, in the negotiation of which Switzerland had been involved, were adopted. Switzerland continued to act as a referee over the Algeciras incident in 1905–6 and later provided a home for Turkish–Balkan negotiations of 1912, leading to the Treaty of Lausanne . However, the Swiss failed to get an International Treaty Agency established in Berne, as the government wanted, while Swiss harbouring of large numbers of Albanian, Turkish and Russian dissidents was not well received abroad.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Switzerland’s unease about its geopolitical situation generated increasing attention to its army , which was slowly being equipped with repeating rifles and machine guns. Reorganizations in 1907 and 1911 expanded the force to 200,000 men and revised its management, its training and its active service rules. Military costs soon accounted for two-thirds of the budget. The wide-ranging changes to the army’s structures approved by the people in 1907 set off a challenge from the Socialists, but were much admired abroad.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unfortunately, the authorities feared, wrongly, that in its quest for <span class="italic">revanche</span>, France might seek to attack Germany through Switzerland. Hence, in 1910 the army offered to share military information with <a id="page_191" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Germany . Two years later, the Kaiser made a very public and controversial visit to Switzerland, ostensibly to observe the annual exercises. In reality he came to ensure that, in the event of war, Switzerland would cover Germany’s southern flank against France. Coming on top of the opposition to the sale of Gotthard shares to Germany and Italy, not to mention irredentist calls emanating from Minister Pedrazzini in Rome, the Kaiser’s visit led French -speakers to feel that the country was getting far too close to the Triple Alliance. The sympathy the German Swiss showed for the new Germany also caused rumours of an Austro-Swiss alliance, which raised concern in the UK .</p>

Swiss officers are in the centre of the picture and other Germans to the right. The visit was politically significant, given Europe’s division into armed camps. While ostensibly the aim was to meet Swiss officers and politicians as good neighbours, the Kaiser – third from left – and his staff also wanted to assure themselves that Swiss forces would be able, in the event of war, to block any French attack on southern Germany through Switzerland.

Its politics were more organized and pluralist than before, although it had turned its back on the revolutionary impulses of the 1840s and 1850s, squeezing out extremism while bringing opposition minorities into the system and also forging a new strongly national and historical identity. Yet, as well as becoming increasingly democratic, Switzerland was also developing an increasingly conservative streak. This found it hard to cope with the demands of the new working class. Hence many Swiss were uneasy and resistant to change. Partly as a result, the country soon found itself facing new internal divisions as well as heightened external challenges.</p>
