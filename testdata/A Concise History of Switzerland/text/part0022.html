<p class="noindent1">– Concept derived from pre-revolutionary France to describe the static and status-bound socio-political order of the European eighteenth century, including in Switzerland, as opposed to the more dynamic post-1798 situation.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3711" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Canton</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Name given in French from the late fifteenth century to describe the ‘<span class="italic">Orte</span>’, that is, the thirteen (XIII) sovereign political units in pre-modern Switzerland. German began to use the term from the late seventeenth century, along with <span class="italic">Stände</span>, and it was formally adopted for the whole country after 1798.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3712" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Challenge</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– One of the two main procedures that characterize Swiss direct democracy: the right of 50,000 citizens to call for a national vote on most new legislation passed by Parliament to which they are opposed. If the legislation fails to get a popular majority it lapses. It is known as a referendum in Switzerland.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3713" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Concordance/consensus</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Swiss style of decision-making, which looks for the widest possible agreement and cooperation, as with the composition of the Federal Council, in contrast to the more antagonistic Anglo-American political style.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3714" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Condominium, condominiums</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Territories annexed by the Swiss and ruled jointly by groups of cantons. Examples are Aargau, Thurgau and Ticino. They are also referred to as ‘common bailliages’ since they were ruled by bailiffs representing, on a rotating basis, the controlling cantons. They also sometimes appear as ‘Mandated Territories’.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3715" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Confederacy/Confederation</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Terms used to describe the overall Swiss polity as distinct from component cantons. In this book we use ‘Confederacy’ to denote the looser organization found prior to 1798 in which the cantons were formally autonomous actors; and ‘Confederation’ to describe the polity defined by mixed national and <a id="page_298" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>cantonal sovereignty that prevailed from 1803 to 1848, and, surprisingly, by the mixed federal structure which succeeded it. Confusingly, in French (and hence often in English as well) the term Confederation is also used, rather than Federation, to describe the post-1848 situation. However, although after 1848 Switzerland was technically a Federation, normal usage has remained ‘Confederation’.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3716" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Democratic Movement</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Series of cantonal processes of constitutional change in the 1860s away from domination by upper-middle-class liberalism and towards direct popular control of decision-making, elections, finance, justice and legislation. The movement was often led by smaller towns and the countryside.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3717" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Direct Democracy</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Political system in which citizens themselves vote directly on major decisions, as well as electing parliamentary representatives to decide issues for them. Citizens can vote on federal constitutions, legislation and treaties. Swiss direct democracy is more extensive at the cantonal than at the federal level, extending to finance, government formation and policy matters, and includes the ability either to propose or to abrogate measures.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3718" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bolditalic">Eidgenossenschaft</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– The traditional German word for the Swiss polity, meaning a fellowship or companionship based on a bond oath or treaty. It still remains the official description of Switzerland in German.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3719" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Federalism</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Both the underlying principle of Swiss governance – which means conciliating local autonomy with central co-ordination – and a political programme. Contrary to British misuse of the term, in Switzerland federalists are supporters of cantonal rights, not of the centre.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3720" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Freisinnig/Radical</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Political movement and party that helped to steer Switzerland from loose confederation to federal unity in the 1840s, and then developed into a conservative force linked to big business. The Radicals held absolute majorities for Parliament for much of the late nineteenth century but have seen their strength decline since.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3721" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bolditalic">Geistige Landesverteidigung</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Concept of defence strategy embracing social and cultural matters as well as military ones; emerged in the late 1930s and guided Swiss thinking into the 1970s.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3722" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bolditalic">Graben</span><span class="bold">/</span><span class="bolditalic">Fossé</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– The split between the German- and Romance-speaking communities over attitudes to the belligerents in the First <a id="page_299" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>World War. A symbol of underlying linguistic division, it spawned the more modern Swiss-German term ‘Röstigraben’ for the barrier, defined in terms of culinary preferences, <span class="italic">Rösti</span> being a favourite potato dish in German-speaking regions.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3723" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Guilds</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Urban confraternities of artisans in specific trades that controlled careers, business organization, marketing, and that sometimes played a formal role in city politics. In the eighteenth century, guilds came to be seen less as a form of quality assurance and more as a restraint on the economy.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3724" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Helvetianism</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Intellectual current emerging in the eighteenth century, which stressed the underlying unity of the Swiss and sought to reflect this in political organization.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3725" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Initiative</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– The second major element of direct democracy, in which a modest number of citizens’ signatures (currently 100,000 at the federal level) triggers a votation on adding a new article to the Federal constitution; or, at the cantonal level, on adding a new article to legislation or to the constitution.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3726" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Laager</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Dutch-derived term used to describe the defensive and introverted world of Swiss catholic society from the mid-nineteenth to the mid twentieth century. Also used of bourgeois politics.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3727" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Landfrieden</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Name for four peace treaties between Catholic and Protestant cantons, often focusing on rights of worship and control of the condominiums (1529, 1531, 1656 and 1715).</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3728" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bolditalic">Landsgemeinde</span> (pl. <span class="italic">Landsgemeinden</span>)</dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Traditional form of male popular assembly embodying local sovereignty used in most pre-modern rural communes, including the Inner Swiss cantons. Now only found in the Inner Rhodes of Appenzell and in Glarus.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3729" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Magic Formula</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Proportional allocation of seats in the Federal Council in relation to the share of the votes cast for each party in elections to the National Council. A major symbol of concordance democracy, especially as the precise allocation formula remained unchanged between 1959 and 2003. Since then many people believe it no longer really operates.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3730" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Mittelland/Midlands</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– The central geographical heartland of Switzerland, sometimes called the Plain, although it is rarely flat. Situated between the Jura hills in the North West and the Alps to the South, and running from Geneva to Thurgau.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3731" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_300" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Neutrality</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– The third of the main pillars of modern Swiss identity, along with direct democracy and federalism. Seen as an essential means of preserving national independence, Swiss neutrality was declared permanent, universal and in the interest of Europe in the Treaty of Vienna (1815). It commits the country to staying out of all armed conflicts (unless invaded) and maintaining universal relations. It is essentially a governmental affair and does not affect popular behaviour or economic relations, provided these are balanced and in line with preceding norms.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3732" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Populism</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Term now given by outsiders to the assertive and rhetorically aggressive style of politics adopted by the Swiss People’s Party (SVP/UDC), which has encouraged polarization in Swiss politics. Populism rests on the assumption that the party is the mouthpiece of the virtuous little people in their just struggle with a corrupt and unrepresentative elite. The party is also marked by charismatic leadership, its stress on direct democracy and its traditionalist nationalism, but it is more focused and organized than similar parties in other European countries.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3733" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Pre-Alps</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Lower reaches of the Alpine Massif, which often provide access points into and through the mountains.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3734" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Regeneration</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Period of constitutional change between 1829 and 1832, which brought in liberal institutions and authorities while also ending the territorial imbalances on which the Ancien Régime had been based.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3735" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bolditalic">Reichsfreiheit</span> <span class="bold">(Imperial Liberty)</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Medieval legal status of a community free of intermediate feudal control, being answerable only to the Holy Roman Emperor – and thus a form of independence, since the Emperor was often far away.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3736" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Schengen and Dublin Accords</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Schengen is a EU system for allowing visa-free movement within the participating countries, within policed borders, while the Dublin Convention makes the country that initially receives them responsible for asylum seekers.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3737" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Schützenverein</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Shooting Club or Carabiniers’ Society – a popular association that played a part in developing national feelings in the nineteenth century.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3738" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bolditalic">Schwyzerdütsch</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– Generic term for the variety of (largely mutually comprehensible) Alemannic dialects of German, spoken in the eastern two-thirds of Switzerland.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3739" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_301" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Sonderbund</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– League of Catholic cantons opposed to religious and political change, the existence of which was held to be contrary to the 1815 Charter, thus triggering the civil war of 1847.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3740" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Sonderfall</span></dt><dd class="def">
<p class="noindent1">– The belief, popular from the 1940s onward, that Switzerland is an especially blessed ‘special case’ – thanks to first surviving the Second World War and then achieving remarkable stability, prosperity, political consensus, social harmony, industrial peace, international independence and general calm.</p>
</dd><dt class="term"><a id="c19444-3741" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><span class="bold">Stillstehen</span></dt><dd class="def">

<p class="noindent1">– Belief, starting in the 1890s, that the country was overwhelmed by foreigners, to the detriment of Swiss wealth and identity. Became a major political theme from the early 1960s onward as Germanophone right-wing politicians increasingly insisted that there were too many foreigners in the country.</p>

<p class="noindent1">– Latinate version of the German term <span class="italic">Abstimmung</span>, meaning any kind of popular vote other than for electing parliaments or governments.
