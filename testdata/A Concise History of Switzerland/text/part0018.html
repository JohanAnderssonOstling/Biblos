<p class="noindent">In 1914 Switzerland was a self-confident and relatively democratic part of the Europe an state system. However, the effects of two world wars and the intervening depression were to test Swiss cohesion and prosperity. The First World War pressed Swiss neutrality hard, especially where linguistic unity and economic security were concerned. The resulting tensions led to an explosion at the end of the war that sent the country off in new political directions, both domestically and diplomatically. The inter-war period brought further extreme economic problems, combined with violent new divisions, often stimulated from outside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Faced with growing Europe an tensions in the 1930s, the Swiss began to batten down the hatches and prepare to defend themselves against external threats, first through better preparation and unity than in 1914, and then through the defensive strategy known as the Reduit. Even so, they did not avoid problems, being sucked into the German war economy and, from 1944, into difficulties with the Allies . Switzerland emerged from the war proud, because the Swiss had survived by strengthening their own democratic unity and resources, but also isolated and mistrusted. In fact, overall, the country had suffered more from events in Europe and beyond than many outside realized.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-2583"><span class="title">Neutrality and Society under Pressure</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The First World War required a major military effort for the Swiss. This went well in terms of mobilization and guarding the frontiers. It <a id="page_194" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>was less successful in dealing with the social and economic costs of maintaining neutrality . Equally, the country was severely tested by the way the war divided it along dangerous linguistic lines.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-2587"><img src="../images/00044.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">7.1 </span>Mobilization for the First World War. The photograph reveals the sheer scale of the initial Swiss call-up on the outbreak of war. Thousands of men assembled in squares across Switzerland, even in Zug, one of the Sonderbund cantons. The 48th Battalion of infantry is here seen taking the oath on 5 August 1914, later than some other places, but in uniform and fully equipped. Though they were ready to be dispatched to guard various parts of the country, few realized that this was the beginning of a long and painful service.</div>
<p class="calibre4">However, few people foresaw these coming trials for neutrality and society. Indeed, when the First World War broke out, Switzerland was in cheerful mood, thanks to the successful third National Exhibition in Berne and the creation of the New Helvetic Society . The government responded quickly to the crisis following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on 28 June, mobilizing 220,000 men by 3 August, who were stationed mainly around the exposed Jura salient at Porrentruy . The same day, Parliament voted the government full powers and elected a General , both for the duration. The choice of a military leader fell <a id="page_195" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>on Ulrich Wille, a 66-year-old professional soldier with an English poetess mother and Prussian connections. This controversial choice, pushed by President Arthur Hoffman , was aimed in part at assuaging German sensitivities, which Hoffman felt necessary in light of the army’s recognized weaknesses. The following day, neutrality was formally declared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Armed neutrality worked well enough during the war so that Switzerland’s territorial integrity was never seriously threatened, even though the war went on far longer than expected. Neutrality also helped to contain the bitter division between the Germanic and Latin language communities, which had been stimulated by the election of the apparently pro-German Wille. At the same time, neutrality imposed great and unbalanced pressures on Swiss society, intensifying the emerging divisions between middle-class conservatives and the organized working class . It also proved hard to defend economically against the combatants’ controls. As a result, the country ended the war in a very divided and explosive state.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although the first deaths in the war are said to have occurred on 2 August close to the Swiss border when French and German patrols collided north of Porrentruy , the actual war never seriously threatened Swiss territory. The initial French invasion of Alsace was quickly forced back, and the two sides dug in along the crests of the Vosges mountains. The southern end of the trenches was far quieter than Flanders, though Swiss soldiers could still hear gunfire. Once the two sides had dug in, moreover, the Swiss were able to demobilize many of their men, leaving only 50,000 in place. Remobilization occurred in late April 1915, when Italy entered the war and troops were stationed in the Grisons and the south, and again in 1916–17, when there were fears that the combatants might try to cross Switzerland to attack their enemies. No major incursions took place, but about a thousand frontier incidents ensued during the war: these included misdirected artillery fire in the Grisons, but four-fifths of them were aerial, as when French planes tried to fly across Swiss territory to bomb the Zeppelin base at Friedrichshafen, or when the Germans bombed Porrentruy in 1916. Because of this, the Swiss built up an air force of some 120 planes by the end of the war, although these were not used well nor backed up by real anti-aircraft support.</p>
<a id="page_196" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Swiss neutrality rested in part on support from the combatants, both diplomatically and militarily. On the one hand, neutrality was strongly supported by Germany in an effort to offset the outrage caused in Switzerland by its destruction of Louvain. The Allies likewise undertook to respect Swiss neutrality. Emboldened by this, the government, as early as November 1914, lent its support to a peace initiative, which came to nothing. Nor did ideas of trying to create a neutral bloc come to fruition. On the other hand, the Swiss also tried to reinforce their military defences by negotiating with the combatants to forestall the possibility of Swiss territory being used for any attacks, as was the case with France in 1915–16 when a German push through Switzerland against Belfort was feared. The negotiations dragged on and ended only with a verbal understanding in 1918. A similar deal with Germany may have been contemplated when the French drew up a Plan H in 1915–16 that envisaged a push on Alsace through Switzerland. However, the French abandoned the idea once Verdun came under attack. The Italians also planned to take up defensive positions in the Ticino in case the Germans sought to attack them through Switzerland.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The government also found it hard to maintain neutrality . Its December 1916 and February 1917 attempts at mediation both failed. Then, in late May 1917, a dispatch from Foreign Minister Hoffman to the Social Democrat MP Robert Grimm , who was then in Russia, was intercepted by the French and passed to the Russian Provisional Government and the Swedish press. The dispatch showed that Hoffman, in an attempt to protect the Swiss economy, was considering a separate German–Russian peace without the knowledge of the rest of the government. This caused outrage not only in the Federal Council and among the Allies, but also in the Suisse Romande , where there were anti-Hoffman demonstrations. He rapidly resigned in an effort to placate French-speakers and those who doubted Swiss neutrality; he was replaced by the 72-year-old Gustave Ador , the President of the Red Cross and the architect of its successful work with prisoners of war.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Neutrality was also tested internally by the emergence of what was called the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3722"><span class="italic">Graben</span></a></span> or <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3722"><span class="italic">fossé</span></a></span> between the language communities. Underlying pre-war tensions were rapidly exacerbated by the war. Generally speaking, German-speakers sympathized with the Central <a id="page_197" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Powers , thanks to the influence of immigration from Germany and admiration for German military prowess and culture – leading some to envisage the end of <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3738"><span class="italic">Schwyzerdütsch</span></a></span>. Many also felt that France was falling apart and that the Germans were bound to win, which made it wise to be on the winning side. French and, later, Italian speakers were more sympathetic to the liberal Allies, to the extent that 7,000 Swiss actually fought under the French flag. They also feared what might happen in a German-dominated Europe, especially after the rape of Belgium. Memories of Bernese German oppression in the Jura during the <span class="italic">Kulturkampf</span> encouraged a secessionist movement there during the war.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Everything that happened after August 1914 was interpreted in terms of these underlying prejudices. Thus, the election of Wille had been seen as a deliberate affront to the Entente. Although at times the conflict took on a physical form, as when Germans were attacked in the streets of Lausanne in 1916, the <span class="italic">Graben</span> was essentially a war of words. Linguistic partisanship was encouraged by the combatants, especially by the Central Powers, who were initially the more adept at lobbying. External actors often bought up or funded the press , since the battle was fought through newspapers, books, magazines, brochures and cartoons, not to mention hearsay. Rumours, denunciations of alleged atrocities and accusations of betrayal by the other language group abounded, as did belief in foreign plots. Both sides developed organizations to defend their interests, such as the 1904 Deutschschweizer Sprachverein under Eduard Blocher and the 1916 Ligue Patriotique Romande.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ironically, some Swiss could seem more extreme than their sponsors. Roman Rolland found some Swiss Germans more expansionist than the Kaiser , while Clemenceau sometimes claimed there were some things he could not do because the Suisse Romande papers would not stand for it. Press censorship was brought in during 1915, although the army handled it so ineptly that the government had to set up mixed committees involving journalists to take over.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So virulent did the controversy become that appeals for calm came as early as August 1914; by November, the government felt it necessary to call publicly for national cohesion. The following month, the well-known poet Carl Spittler gave a famous lecture on ‘Our Swiss Standpoint’, urging his compatriots not to take sides, but to <a id="page_198" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>remember that they were all brothers who should unite to maintain the neutral Swiss state. The Suisse Romande historian Paul Seippel made similar statements. These interventions seem to have had some effect, as things calmed down somewhat in 1915. But argument flared up again in 1916, with demonstrations and near riots after the emergence of what was called the ‘Colonels’ affair’ , in which Colonels Egli and Wattenwil of the General Staff were arrested for passing on Swiss intelligence briefings to German military attachés. The mild sentences imposed by Wille caused outrage in French-speaking regions, and the <span class="italic">Courrier de Vevey</span> accused the government of preparing to let German troops pass through Switzerland in order to attack Belfort.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The war also intensified social pressures. Soldiers had to serve an average of 608 days during the war, during which they were subject to fierce discipline and drill but long denied equipment such as steel helmets, gas masks or machine guns. The army offered few means of offsetting the boredom of frontier watch, in which tranquillity was only disturbed by the odd poacher. Most importantly, soldiers received only pocket money, and there was no compensation to families for the loss of their breadwinner. The lack of pay drove many families towards destitution at a time when prices were rising twice as fast as wages. War taxation was a further burden for many. By 1917 some 700,000 of the country’s 4 million people were in distress, and the number of births and marriages fell. Food riots broke out in 1916–17 when unrestricted submarine warfare cut down food imports. At the same time, some firms and farms were making large profits. Thus, it is not surprising either that desertion occurred or that some 5,000 conscripts joined a soldiers’ trade union. Unwisely, the government turned its face against helping out workers and their families. Thus, it limited rights of association and repealed factory legislation, and it was slow to introduce rationing, which did not really become widespread until 1916–17. As a result, along with resentment of the officer class, class antagonisms grew during the war.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Indeed, it was probably the economic policies of the belligerents that placed both neutrality and Swiss society under the greatest pressure. Both sides wanted to ensure that goods they sent to Switzerland were not passed on to the other side – and neither side <a id="page_199" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>trusted the Swiss to deliver. In August 1915, the Allies created a Swiss-based agency, the Swiss Society for Economic Surveillance, to control Swiss exports and imports, most of which were channelled through the Mediterranean port of Sète. These conditions were sufficiently constraining that Wille even thought Switzerland might have to resort to fighting on the Central Powers’ side in order to maintain its independence, although the latter followed suit with the Schweizerische Treuhandstelle. Reconciling the belligerents’ conflicting demands was difficult, especially as both sides knew the country would pay a high price to preserve its supplies and neutrality . Switzerland was dependent on Germany for coal and manufactured goods and on the Allies for foodstuffs and colonial goods. Coal shortages forced the government first to cancel Sunday trains and then to take direct control of the railways . Meanwhile, the subsistence crisis meant that Switzerland had to do even more trade with the Allies, which called its impartiality into question.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The war thus became a major challenge for the economy. Raw material imports fell off, making it harder to export, and after a good year in 1916, pressure increased, notably for textiles . Declining exports meant many layoffs at a time when there was no national unemployment pay. Tourism also suffered very badly, and even banks faced problems, though they managed to fight off new state controls and rules on disclosure. Some large-scale farmers benefited from rising prices, but smaller peasant farms sold less and were disproportionately hit by taxation , inflation and a shortage of labour. Financing the war was another economic burden. Borrowing pushed the national debt up from 146 million francs in 1913 to 1817 million in 1919. Conditions also weighed heavily on the Swiss franc. The state had to increase taxation through war taxes , a profits tax and a higher stamp duty, all of which exacerbated social problems, which were to explode as the war came to an end.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-2663"><span class="title">The Post-War Socio-Political Crisis</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The government had not handled war conditions well, partly because of the innate conservatism it shared with much of mainstream society. This was increasingly exacerbated by the fear of ‘Bolshevism ’ generated by the Russian Revolution . All this had both immediate <a id="page_200" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>political effects and even more serious medium-term implications. Worsening class divisions and economic pressures exploded in 1918, causing a dramatic social upheaval. The forces of conservatism managed to overcome the General Strike , but had to concede Proportional Representation (PR), leading to a new era in political relations. At the same time, the country moved away from absolute neutrality through membership in the League of Nations. These developments were to mark the country for years to come.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Initially, however, the government’s failings – including the Hoffman affair – primarily affected the elections of October 1917, in which the Social Democrats , the Catholic Conservatives and the Democrats won seats from Liberals and Radicals . The latter party’s position was further weakened when younger elements began demanding a more interventionist approach to the economy. Their agrarian allies were also getting increasingly restless and worried about socialism , seen in the growth of trade union strength and in the number of strikes. At the same time, the Swiss left was preoccupied by the emergence of a new communist movement, led by Lenin at the Zimmerwald and Kienthal conferences in 1915 and 1916, which called on the working class to wage civil war to gain power. Although the Swiss working class did not take much notice of this, the Social Democrats did begin to attack Swiss defence policy, its financing and its lack of democracy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By 1917, Lenin famously believed that the country was ripe for revolution, as did the United States. The establishment, Wille and much of middle-class society also became increasingly alarmed by the apparent Bolshevik threat. Leftist enthusiasm and bourgeois fears both intensified suspicion of foreigners , who were increasingly seen as synonymous with political extremists. Hence, in 1917 the Federal Council took over the policing of aliens from the cantons , even though the number of foreigners went down from 600,000 (14.7 per cent of the population) in 1914 to 402,000 (10.4 per cent) in 1920.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In fact, Switzerland did experience a socio-political explosion at the end of the war – one caused not by foreign agitators, but by the social unease resulting from the catastrophic fall in living standards induced by the war, together with the government’s misplaced activism. In early 1918, the government chose to impose a <a id="page_201" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>new month-long obligatory period of civilian service, centring on public works projects. This additional burden on the working classes forced the Social Democrats and the unions , grouped together in what became known as the Olten Committee , to start planning for a general strike in line with syndicalist thinking. On 30 September of that year, a strike for higher wages broke out amongst Zurich bank clerks, supported by the working class. Tensions were also increased by the October Revolution in Russia, which led to a supportive march in Zurich on 17 October. The demonstration turned into a riot in which a policeman was killed. Wille and others sought to stop the feared revolution in its tracks and, at the request of the Zurich authorities, who found themselves without military support, sent <a id="page_202" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>troops under the pro-German Colonel Sonderegger into the city. On 10 November, Sonderegger’s men fired on demonstrators, wounding three; the Olten Committee responded on 12 November by calling a strike and issuing a nine-point reform programme. Some 250,000 workers, mainly from the railway and metallurgical industries of German-speaking Switzerland , answered the call. Although the strike was almost entirely peaceful, Wille mobilized 100,000 men, mainly from rural and Catholic cantons, and occupied Zurich. Faced with this, the Olten committee ordered workers back to work, and the strike subsided.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-2698"><img src="../images/00045.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">7.2 </span>Deployment of troops to put down the General Strike of mid-November 1918. The outbreak of the strike, driven by social hardship, elite intransigence and military aggression, caused Wille and the army leadership to fear that the country was facing a Bolshevik revolution. They therefore flooded Zurich with troops drawn from rural and Catholic cantons, including the threatening-looking cavalry shown here. This show of force forced the strike leaders to back down, leaving a bitter legacy of social and political resentment.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Nonetheless, when combined with the effects of the war and the introduction of proportional representation , the strike dramatically changed Swiss politics. To begin with, the new electoral system – which soon spread to more cantons – delivered the Radicals their worst election result since 1848. The party lost half its seats – including many moderates – and ended with sixty, only nineteen more than those claimed by both Social Democrats and Catholic Conservatives. This outcome was both a real political earthquake and a dividing line in Swiss political history, moving the country from majoritarianism to a highly proportional and pluralist political culture .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nonetheless, in 1919 the right still enjoyed a majority, thanks to the vehemently anti-socialist attitudes of both the Catholics – whose episcopate came out against socialism – and the emerging agrarian party in Berne and Zurich, which held thirty seats and coalesced as the Burghers , Artisans and Peasants Party (BGB/PAB) in 1921. In fact, the election created a new bourgeois, nationalist and peasant bloc, which used the strike as a pretext for dismissing left-wing concerns. Opposition to the left also took an increasingly activist form with the foundation of militant civil guard organizations like the anti-Semitic Patriotic Federations created by a Germanophile army doctor, Eugen Bircher . His movement reflected a growing xenophobia in Swiss society, which continued into the mid-1920s with a harsh new naturalization law in 1921 and complete confederal control of foreigners ’ affairs in 1925. That same year, Bircher’s force evolved into a new and more sinister organization, the Heimatwehr. Nevertheless, the electorate did reject a new security law giving the government increased police powers, the so-called Lex Häberlin, in 1922.</p>
<a id="page_203" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">The general political move to the right, reinforcing earlier trends as it did, meant that the Social Democrats , despite their new-found electoral strength, remained very much outside the charmed circle of political power. Their exclusion was intensified by their resentment of the army because of its wartime class bias and its actions against the strike . These positions, along with the intense polarization of the post-war period, meant that there could be no question of allowing the Social Democrats a seat in the government. Indeed, in 1919 Parliament chose a second, and violently anti-socialist, Catholic, Jean-Marie Musy of Fribourg, for the Federal Council. Their exclusion led the SPS to make more use of direct democratic initiatives to advance their ideas, although the continuing conservatism of the electorate meant they achieved few of their goals. For example, a 1921 social-democratic proposal for a wealth tax was heavily defeated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">International developments reinforced the growing domestic divide. In 1919, the nearly unanimous desire of the Austrian province of Voralberg to become part of Switzerland was turned down by the Swiss authorities, fearful that it would upset the religious and linguistic balance of the country, as well as raising questions about neutrality and defensibility. Much more significant were the debates on the League of Nations. Switzerland had remained largely outside the Versailles negotiations, which were not sympathetic to neutrality , but in the end it did secure special status under Article 435 that exempted it from military involvement in the League. Entry to the League enjoyed strong support from people like the independent conservative Minister Ado r, who saw the League as a barrier to communism. However, the League also posed problems because it envisioned economic sanctions, which meant that Switzerland would be forced to adopt differential neutrality. Membership was therefore vehemently opposed by right-wing movements, including the Volksbund für die Unabhängigkeit der Schweiz led by Eduard Blocher . Entry was put to a popular vote, even though this was not strictly necessary, and barely passed on 16 May 1920. Had a few votes in Appenzell gone the other way, membership would not have gained a cantonal majority. Eight months later, the electorate made it a rule that long-lasting treaties had to be approved by a votation. At the same time the government annoyed the League by refusing to let <a id="page_204" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> peace-keeping forces pass through the country en route to Vilnius. League recognition of neutrality also ended the demilitarization of Savoy and the free zones around Geneva . When popular resistance prevented a new deal in 1923, these zones lapsed altogether. Public opinion, however, remained solidly behind Switzerland’s refusal to have diplomatic relations with the USSR .</p>
<p class="calibre4">The unease underlying attitudes towards the League and towards social reform rested in part on the deteriorating economic climate. After a brief boom at the end of the war when exports soared, a new financial crisis in 1922 developed as the reparations crisis hit Europe. Swiss holdings were badly affected as old competitors – often highly protectionist – returned to the market at a time when high inflation and Swiss levies made its exports expensive. Textile and watch exports declined sharply, while unemployment rose, reaching 100,000, exacerbated by conservative resistance to any remedial measures. This was evidence that the crisis had not overturned the pre-existing political balance.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-2744"><span class="title">Slump and Ideological Conflict</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In fact fears of foreigners and the rising left not only persisted, but became stronger and more radical despite the fact that the mid-1920s were a much better period for the Swiss economy. Polarization increased when the renewed economic growth was brutally reversed by the slump that followed in 1929, which caused real hardship, especially when met by austere economic policies. Although these were eventually replaced by more interventionist stances, forced on government by the depth of the depression, the actual onset of the slump encouraged many Swiss, like others in Europe, to look for new extreme answers to their problems, at times calling post-1848 achievements into question, sometimes violently. In the end, the country largely overcame the threat from totalitarianism and kept the rising power of the left at bay.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the 1920s, once German hyper-inflation was tamed, Switzerland began to prosper again. The economy thrived in the second half of the 1920s, seeing not just growth but also restructuring, with agriculture losing further ground to services , notably bank ing and tourism. Retailing also changed with the emergence of <a id="page_205" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> Gottlieb Duttweiler ’s pioneering mobile grocery vans, bitterly resisted by conventional shopkeepers but welcomed by consumers. Manufacturing continued its shift away from textiles to metals, chemicals and food, where Nestlé became increasingly important. Both national income and wages rose. Growth may also explain why the electorate, having in May 1925 rejected a proposal to create pensions and accident insurance , accepted a government counter-project that December.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Politically, however, Catholics, farmers and the middle classes remained absorbed with fears of a communist revolution. Hence, they drifted further to the right , intellectually and practically. The influence of the French Action Française and Italian fascism was strong on writers like Gonzague de Reynold and Georges Oltremare in the Suisse Romande. A few <span class="italic">fascii</span> were set up, and Wille hosted a lecture by Adolf Hitler in 1923. By the end of the decade, such tendencies were reinforced in the Federal Council by the election of Marcel Pilet-Golaz , a Vaudois Radical, and then by Rudolf Minger of the BGB, which was then perhaps the most anti-liberal and anti-socialist party. Minger’s election represented a blunt rejection of calls that the Social Democrats, who were beginning to moderate their positions, should be allowed into the government. Cat holic Conservatives also made gains in the 1928 general elections, even though foreign relations were less tense at this time. The Volksbund continued to object to Swiss participation in League committees, and the government was hesitant to go beyond encouraging international arbitration and developing its good offices role. Neutrality was strengthened when service in bodies like the Foreign Legion was finally banned. Yet at the same time, Dornier was allowed to set up factories in Switzerland to circumvent Versailles bans on German rearmament, while Motta , the long-serving foreign minister, and Musy ensured a very anti-Bolshevik foreign policy . Even though by 1930 the number of foreigners had fallen to only 8.7 per cent of the population, a harsh new law on foreigners came into effect in 1931.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By then, Switzerland was experiencing the disastrous effects of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, which led the country into a wrenching depression after 1932, with consequences that had still not fully ended when war broke out again in 1939. GDP and asset values fell dramatically, the balance of payments surplus was almost wiped <a id="page_206" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>out by foreign protectionism , and capital began to flow out of the country. Despite its desire to reduce expenditure, the government stepped in to save some banks. Business sought to stop Duttweiler ’s Migros from opening new shops, leading him to start franchising his own brand of cheap, prepacked basic goods. In 1935 he branched out into HotelPlan, giving services a double boost. Industry suffered particularly badly, with watch-making losing a third of its labour force, something which helped to push unemployment up to 124,000 or 6.5 per cent of the workforce. Agriculture faced declining prices, as well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Great Depression brought severe social problems to Switzerland, notably poverty caused by wage cuts and limited unemployment pay. Many families were forced to look to charity. The shortage of work made female emancipation even less likely, with all cantonal propositions being rejected out of hand. Strikes also became more common, notably between 1930 and 1932, and the Social Democrats began to gain ground. By 1936, they had become the largest party, taking seats from all three right-wing parties. The latter remained cool on social measures to help the unemployed, preferring to establish higher indirect taxes and other deflationary measures. Social Democratic calls for a minimum wage, price controls and other crisis measures were all rejected. Additionally, proposals to implement pensions and accident reform were blocked, holding back Switzerland’s entry into the Europe an welfare mainstream. However, the electorate did reject structural wage cuts, directed mainly against the civil service . In November 1932, the division between the working classes and the right-wing majority came to a head in Geneva when untrained conscripts fired on a left-wing protest march, killing thirteeen and wounding sixty-three. The event became a national scandal that damaged the army ’s reputation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The deteriorating economy enabled the left to gather 334,000 signatures on its anti-crisis initiative. In response, the government was forced into limited and often messy interventionism. It first sought to save the watch industry by creating a new holding company, the ASUAG, and by banning the establishment of all new watch-making firms. Next, the government was forced to take stakes in failing banks . To justify this, it sponsored a new banking law in 1934 that made the breach of banking secrecy a criminal offence, a <a id="page_207" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_208" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>step aimed at governments in France and Weimar Germany , which had sought to stop reparations money leaking to Switzerland. In 1934 a special package of measures to help farmers passed, even though these initiatives added to the state’s escalating costs. Local authorities in Biel also persuaded General Motors to open a factory there. Finance Minister Musy sought to push the Federal Council into further fiscal retrenchment in 1934, and resigned when his efforts failed. This opened the way for a 30 per cent devaluation of the franc in September 1936.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-2796"><img src="../images/00046.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">7.3 </span>An election-time satire on the proliferation of right-wing Fronts in the early 1930s. It shows they shared very similar names and were led by enthusiastic publicists who fought over a very small and bemused electorate. The fact that many of these right-wing groupuscles were foreign inspired and funded is made clear by the rear of the two plinths in the foreground. The cartoonist also draws attention to the fragility of such movements. The cartoon points the way to the rapid decline of the Fronts.</div>
<p class="calibre4">The government’s inability to do more encouraged far-right movements that began to push for a radical change in Swiss institutions. In the early 1930s, some forty so-called ‘Fronts ’ on the Italian and German model emerged. Often confusingly overlapping, some were internally generated while others had international support, as did the Lega Nazionale Ticinese and the Front Fasciste Suisse of former colonel Arthur Fonjallaz , both of which gained aid from Mussolini. Germany was behind both the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718">Eidgenössische Front</a></span> and the Swiss branch of the German Nazi party under Wilhelm Gustloff. The largest movements were the Nationale Front and, in the Suisse Romande, Oltremare’s Union Nationale. Usually urban , coming especially from Berne, Zurich and Schaffhausen, the Front organizations often had roots in universities and youth movements. Believing that Switzerland was degenerate and in need of renewal, they were anti-democratic, anti-liberal and anti-Semitic , and sought a Switzerland that was more corporatist than capitalist, more security conscious, and with clearer leadership. Their agendas placed them well outside the mainstream of Swiss conservatism .</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Front movements’ first success came in early 1933, when they won a number of seats in Zurich and Geneva in what came to be known as the springtime of the Fronts. They attracted far fewer votes, however, than did Duttweiler ’s new anti-establishment and anti-extremist Landesring party. Thereafter, the Fronts concentrated on wholesale revision of the constitution , a simple target that appealed to many voters. They raised 78,000 signatures for reform, and gained some celebrity supporters like Sonderegger , but when it came to the vote in September 1935, the Fronts’ initiative attracted only 196,000 votes and went down to a comprehensive defeat, along with a proposed tougher internal security law.</p>
<a id="page_209" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Electoral defeat sent the Fronts into decline. They were also undermined by a Gestapo kidnapping on Swiss territory, by internal splits between extremists and moderates, and by government action. The Federal Council, though it allowed a councillor at the German embassy to carry on organizing, demanded an end to the national structure of the Swiss NSDAP, and eventually shut it down in 1937. Economic revival also helped to reduce support for fascism in Switzerland. As the devaluation of the franc and the reopening of German markets spurred recovery in exports and tourism, new jobs were created and share values rose. The resulting increase in prosperity paved the way for a boom in new consumer goods like electric cookers, phones and radios. Nonetheless, conditions remained threatening, forcing the Swiss, who saw the swing to the extreme right as a warning signal, to decide how to confront the rising menace.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-2812"><span class="title">Battening Down the Hatches</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the late 1930s, therefore, the political mood changed. The emergence of an indigenous fascist movement, even if its dynamism had been blunted, and the increasingly vocal sabre-rattling of the neighbouring totalitarian regimes was doubly worrying. It made the Swiss increasingly self-conscious about their position in Europe, and it encouraged reassessment of their own cultural and political identity both on the governmental side and on the left. Because of the totalitarian threat, the Social Democrats moved away from their anti-military stance and drew closer to mainstream politics. Together, these developments propelled both government and people away from international cooperation and towards greater reliance on their own resources. While the country remained suspicious of foreigners , it also began to develop a new ideology of resistance clearly demarcated from fascist thinking. Eventually, the country also began to rethink its military and political position, first rearming and preparing for war and then, after the Nazi onslaught in the West, creating a heavily defended Alpine fortress, the Reduit .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Federal Council lor Minger of the BGB , who believed that war would come by 1939, was responsible for reviving the previously neglected army. In 1936, he secured a larger budget and also <a id="page_210" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>established a War Loan. Next, he introduced a new strategic order , based on more, smaller and better-equipped divisions, and an extension of recruit schooling to three months. Finally, he sought to prepare society for war by creating a War Economy cell in 1937, which addressed the issue of supporting soldiers’ families and encouraging both the state and households to build up stocks of basic goods: two months’ reserves of food and necessities for the latter. Foreign policy remained caught in the past, at first, conservatively neutra l except towards the USSR (to the extent that Switzerland sought to block the USSR’s entry to the League of Nations). The government adopted an extreme position on the Abyssinian War, not even letting Haile Selassie live in his villa in Vevey. In 1939, Switzerland also recognized Franco’s regime well before the Spanish Civil War had ended, even though 800 Swiss volunteered to fight on the Republican side, 300 of whom lost their lives.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the mid-1930s, the Swiss also compromised their neutrality by their treatment of refugees from Nazi Germany . Many of these were Jews who were forced out or pressured into leaving for Switzerland. The movement of refugees led to the feeling among some Swiss that the country was being ‘Jewified’, even though the numbers involved actually declined during the inter-war years. Hitler ’s Anschluss with Austria in 1938 threatened a new flood of émigrés, moreover, which the conventionally anti-Semitic Heinrich Rothmund , head of the Federal Police Service, wanted to control by forestalling the arrival of many Jewish refugees who could not be returned to Germany. Imposing a visa requirement on all Austrians would have annoyed the Germans; instead, Rothmund accepted the Nazi regime’s suggestion that Jewish citizens should have the letter J stamped on their passports. The measure solved a short-term problem for the worried Swiss, but had a permanently detrimental effect on Switzerland’s reputation. During these years, rules on the registration of all foreigners were tightened, and press controls were introduced after complaints from Berlin about critical reporting on the Nazi movement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The left was far more alarmed by the totalitarian threat than was the government, and therefore sought to move further towards the political mainstream. The Social Democrats revised their policies, <a id="page_211" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>abandoning both the dictatorship of the proletariat and their opposition to national defence. Their delegates voted for war credits in 1936, which turned them into an orthodox political party rather than a counter-culture. Though conservatives still felt socialism to be unpatriotic, in fact the left was increasingly falling in behind ideas of national resistance and identity . Hence, very significantly, on 19 July 1937, the unions under Ernst Dübi signed a no strike/no lockout agreement, the so-called Labour Peace, with major employers led by Konrad Il g from Von Roll. This settlement reflected the left’s realization that the division between workers and bosses had played into the Nazis’ hands in Germany, something they wanted to prevent in Switzerland. Social Democratic moderation did not stop cantonal governments from banning the Communist Party, urged on by Musy ’s National Anti-Bolshevik Association. Nor did it persuade the other parties to elect a Social Democrat to the Federal Council, since fear of the party’s revolutionary and anti-military potential remained. However, the government did promise new economic policies more acceptable to the left.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Labour Peace turned out to be the pivotal element in a general policy switch towards greater self-reliance, producing what has been called the hedgehog syndrome . Swiss neutrality was restored to its integral form in 1938 when Foreign Minister Motta withdrew Switzerland from the League of Nations. In the same year, in a hands-off signal to Mussolini , who was making threatening noises about the <span class="italic">Italianità</span> of Ticino and the Grigioni , a referendum made Romansh a national language. Switzerland’s linguistic integrity – and its difference from Nazi Germany – was also furthered by increasing public use of <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3738"><span class="italic">Schwyzerdütsch</span></a></span> , which acquired a new supporting organization in 1938. The public celebration of Swiss identity continued with the opening of the Museum of Federal Charters in Schwyz in 1937 and the defence of Tell offered by historians like Karl Meyer against German doubters. Much of this was summed up in the Zurich <span class="italic">Landi</span> or national exhibition of 1939.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In addition, the government sought to give moral and intellectual cohesion to various initiatives and to the nation as a whole under the label of <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3721"><span class="italic">Geistige Landesverteidigung</span></a></span> , or spiritual national defence. The term had been launched by a Radical MP in 1929 when inveighing against over-foreignization, and was taken up by the press , <a id="page_212" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>including some Frontist journalists. It was really brought to the fore, however, by the new Catholic Conservative Minister Philip Etter , notably in a famous government Message of December 1938 that urged a defence of Swiss culture. Promoted through stamps, children’s books and official publications, the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3721"><span class="italic">Geistige Landesverteidigung</span></a></span> proved very popular by encouraging a new ‘common sense’ way of thinking about Switzerland, its past and identity that distinguished it from Nazi <span class="italic">Völkisch</span> thinking by stressing heroic ideals, collectivism and the Alps as a fortress. The concept thus helped the country unite, prepare for and survive the coming war.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Second World War imposed a new set of stresses on Switzerland, because of Axis racism and totalitarianism and the perceived threat to Swiss territorial integrity. The war provoked less internal division than between 1914 and 1918, but it also raised new moral questions and practical challenges. The outbreak of war, when it finally came, saw another smooth process of initial mobilization , voting of full powers, declaration of neutrality and election of a general . Parliament’s choice in 1939 was less controversial than in 1914, falling on Henri Guisan , a 61-year-old Romand farmer turned professional soldier, linguistically adept and conservative, who was to become a national hero during the war. By early September 1939, he had some 430,000 men under arms , although most of these were soon sent home after the declaration of war led not to conflict in the west, but the so-called Phoney War. The lull allowed the authorities to develop their preparations, with Guisan creating the <span class="italic">Heer im Haus</span> agency to support morale amongst bored soldiers and to encourage ideas of Swissness amongst the civilian population. Significantly, performances of Schiller ’s <span class="italic">William Tell</span> in the Zurich theatre were extremely popular at this time. Female volunteers were also organized into a formal Complementary Women ’s Service, while soldiers’ pay was guaranteed in the December 1939 Compensation Fund for Mobilized Soldiers, into which firms and wage earners paid 4 per cent. By the autumn, rationing of products like flour, rice and sugar was introduced, along with controls on prices, rents and services, as the government sought to ensure that it could manage the inevitable hardships of war. The government also sought to work out its economic relationships with the belligerents, <a id="page_213" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>since both sides wanted to control Swiss trade – whether, in the case of Germany, to stop raw materials getting to the Allies , or in the Allies’ case, to ensure continuing supplies of Swiss weapons. The latter proved harder to negotiate than a deal with Germany.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Guisan was very aware that the Swiss army was probably too weak to stop any German push into Switzerland. He therefore put out feelers to the French about providing support on the army’s left flank, should the Nazis attack. Such plans went out the window in May 1940, however, when the Wehrmacht began its Blitzkrieg. The Swiss remobilized on a larger scale, but failed to avert a popular panic on 15–16 May when the Germans feinted an attack between Basle and Schaffhausen. The feint left Guisan’s forces on the Limmat line in the wrong place, with Guderian’s panzers on their flank and rear. Guderian’s army moved on into France on 16 June, but Switzerland remained doubly exposed, because by then Italy had entered the war, meaning that the country was wholly surrounded by the Axis. The Germans found evidence of the Swiss staff talks with the French, which were discovered in a train at La Charité sur Loire . Since no corresponding talks with the Wehrmacht had taken place, the documents called Swiss neutrality very much into question. The country was in great danger, and invasion seemed to be a real possibility. Indeed, the German General staff worked on an invasion plan, known as Operation Tannenbaum , from late June until 17 October. The Swiss air force also found itself having to repel frequent Luftwaffe incursions. Swiss success annoyed Goering, who unsuccessfully sent in saboteurs to try to disrupt the Swiss interceptors.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Responding to the threat provoked a divisive domestic crisis when, on 26 June, Ministers Pilet-Golaz and Etter made broadcasts urging the Swiss to adjust to the new circumstances in which they found themselves and to accept the ‘sure guidance’ of the Federal Council . The addresses reflected conservatives’ impatience with the slowness of the Swiss system and their desire for more authoritarian governance that they believed could ensure Swiss independence . But their ambiguous statement prompted a response diametrically different from what they intended. The army’s partial demobilization and the apologies offered for the aerial clashes led many officers to fear that the government no longer intended to resist a German attack. They were also worried by the revival of the Fronts , whose actions also <a id="page_214" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_215" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>called neutrality into question, especially when some Frontist leaders were formally received by Pilet-Golaz on 10 September. One group of officers even considered a putsch, for which they were briefly imprisoned. Still, the military’s concerns led to an open National Resistance Association, while at the same time De Rougemon t and others founded the Gotthard League to focus civilian resistance against Nazism.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-2895"><img src="../images/00047.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">7.4 </span>Guisan at Rütli. A photograph taken on 25 July 1940, when Henri Guisan, then head of the army, addressed virtually the entire Swiss officer corps at the famous Rütli meadow above Lake Lucerne, where the three founders of the Confederacy had supposedly taken their oath to liberty centuries before. In what was called his ‘Report’, Guisan – who is the single figure nearest to the lake – sought to reassure his officers that he planned to resist any German offensive, notwithstanding the fall of France, and to inform them of the Reduit strategy they would therefore be following. His initiative succeeded, and the meeting has itself become legend. Indeed the fact that he autographed a copy of the picture for his son Henri junior, then an army subaltern, shows that he was aware of the historic nature of the event.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Meanwhile, Guisan was thinking of a military response to the Blitzkrieg and the country’s new encirclement. The campaign of 1939 had convinced him that a mobile Swiss strategy would not work, but that, like the Finns, the Swiss might be able to hold defensive positions. A staff report was drawn up on 13 June, but Guisan remained doubtful, and it was only on 9 July that he opted for an echeloned defence, the last line of which would be in the fortified Alps. His strategy was conceived not just to dissuade invasion, but also to provide a base for counter-attacks if the invasion came. Two weeks later, he took the striking and risky step of summoning all his field officers to the historic Rütli meadow overlooking Lake Lucerne to explain his will to resist and the way in which this was to be done through the Reduit , as it became known. The meeting had an electrifying effect on the army, whose morale greatly improved, while annoying Berlin. Public opinion took longer to be impressed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the event, parts of the army began to fall back to the Alps to start new defensive works: series of demolition points, camouflaged gun emplacements, anti-tank barriers and hidden airfields, all backed up by barracks, stores and services. Half the army was soon dug in, and eventually 360,000 men were stationed in the Reduit, at a cost of some 900 million francs. Economic defence was strengthened by encouraging the population to join what was called the ‘battle of the fields’ – also known as the Wahlen Plan after one of its publicists – to increase the amount of land used to grow crops. By the use of football pitches and even the lawns in front of the Bundeshaus , the amount of land given over to crops was doubled. A merchant marine to help bring in much-needed supplies was also established. However, although the first crises of the war were thus overcome, challenges and problems were far from over.</p>
<a id="page_216" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><h3 class="sec" id="c19444-2905"><span class="title">The Encircled Hedgehog</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In fact, the war pressed on the country partly because of its geographical situation, surrounded on all sides as it was by the Axis , and partly because of its own economic needs. Thus the Swiss remained under uncomfortable pressure from the Axis, fearful of invasion and pressured into considerable economic cooperation, especially when the Nazi invasion of Russia made Swiss industry increasingly attractive to Germany . On the whole, the nation’s hedgehog strategy and identity sustained firm resistance to Nazi ideology, as well as encouraging social and political cohesion and left-leaning reform at home. At the same time, Swiss fears also led to harsher stances over refugees and humanitarian obligations.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Early in the war, despite improvements in self-sufficiency, and even though the Swiss continued to fear a German attack, the nation found itself sucked into Germany’s economic embrace. Operation Tannenbaum might have been implemented had the Luftwaffe won the Battle of Britain, or had planning for Operation Barbarossa against Russia not started in December 1940 as it did. Hitler may also have felt that encirclement and the combined effects of propaganda and internal sympathies would bring Switzerland into the Axis camp without fighting. Indeed, a number of businessmen and others, many linked with the Volksbund , presented the government with the so-called ‘Petition of 200’ on 15 November 1940 demanding tight control of the press , while leading officers, including Ulrich Wille Jr. and his ally Colonel Gustav Däniker , attacked Guisan ’s handling of the war and called for a more German-friendly stance. The government did not give way, owing in part to the arrival of the hardliner Eduard von Steiger of the BGB and Walter Stämpfli , a left-leaning Radical who won plaudits for his handling of the war economy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Economically, Switzerland’s double dependence on Germany for both raw materials and markets for its manufactures made it hard to resist German pressure. Thus, in August 1940 the government agreed to a large-scale credit for Germany. Financing this and the war weighed heavily on the population, who faced a war profits tax , a Sacrifice Tax, a National Defence tax, a levy on rich refugees and, from July 1941, a consumption tax. Rationing also tightened, as did <a id="page_217" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> the new controls on economic activity – running to 1,800 ordinances – which aimed, not always successfully, at keeping inflation low, creating jobs and adjusting wages to prices. The government’s approach represented a major shift away from pre-war views of the state and its functions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The launching of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941 forced Germany to move to a war economy, which in turn made Swiss military production extremely attractive to the Nazi regime. Berlin’s tentative invasion plans were revisited, and a <span class="italic">Gauleiter</span> was chosen to run the new client state that Hitler envisioned. Moreover, Swiss sympathy for the Nazis increased somewhat when the Wehrmacht took on the ‘Bolsheviks’; Eugen Bircher even took three medical missions to the Eastern Front between October 1941 and June 1942. The German plan had again to be set aside, however, when Barbarossa ran into difficulties. And when Däniker circulated a report about a visit to Germany that urged Swiss entry into the new Nazi order, he was imprisoned on Guisan’s orders. By this time, Guisan ’s step was in line with majority opinion. The press was almost uniformly hostile to Nazism, despite censorship and incessant German complaints. The public was more inclined to watch patriotic films like <span class="italic">Gilberte de Courgenay</span> or to celebrate the 650th Anniversary of the foundation of the Confederation – which made much use of the Tell legend – than to support totalitarianism. A wide range of forces encouraged the public’s increasing hostility to the Nazi movement, including among churches and satirists. Social Democratic policies for a ‘New Switzerland’, which included an initiative on pensions, also had support from the Radicals , emphasizing the general move away from Nazi models. However, the establishment still remained resistant to the idea of allowing a Social Democrat into the government.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Given this lack of popular sympathy, Germany turned to economic leverage, available because Switzerland needed military markets to replace disappearing civilian orders and to provide much-needed work. Minds were concentrated by food riots in Steinen in September 1942. Neither the government nor the public was keen to ask what Swiss firms in Germany did, even when some did adopt racist language and use forced labour. The Swiss Railways also provided discounts to the Germans, including for the transit of much-needed <a id="page_218" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>coal to Switzerland. Concern about Nazi attitudes also affected the Swiss policy on refugees by reinforcing ingrained conservative attitudes toward foreigners . The authorities persisted in a hedgehog attitude, treating refugees as a threat partly because they were aware that taking too many would also get them in bad odour with Berlin. Even a year after news of the Holocaust had reached Switzerland, Police Chief Rothmund ordered the frontiers closed and all illegals deported; Minister Von Steiger then infamously declared that ‘the boat is full’ to justify the policy. The government’s move was bitterly attacked in many quarters, including by the theologian Karl Barth; in response, the government somewhat relaxed its approach. However, although the policy was largely determined by <span class="italic">raison d’état</span>, because of deep-seated anti-Semitism , the policy received warm support from the Swiss Patriotic Federation and the Young Radicals. Some argued that because Jews did not share the religious affiliations of the native Swiss, excluding them did not infringe the country’s safe haven tradition. Additionally, these voices noted, German Jews were not political refugees as such, and the country had no obligation towards them. For those holding such a view, refugees also posed an economic problem because they were a further burden on an already strained economy. The Police Department vehemently denied accusations of inhuman treatment of refugees, although those eventually allowed in were subject to severe conditions. A further tightening of policy occurred in December 1942 when the Nazi occupation of Vichy France increased the exodus of refugees. Public-spirited individuals like the St Gallen policeman Paul Grüninger, who helped refugees, paid a high price for doing so.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The war did bring other intense economic pressures, although not because of the refugees. National income and per capita GDP both fell to low levels while debt rose, thanks to having to spend 80 per cent of the state budget on the military, which also got preference in food supplies. As rationing became increasingly tight and prices outstripped wages, a black market developed. Women suffered particularly from difficult conditions, though births and marriages did rise during the war. The war also made the Swiss economy increasingly dependent on Germany, which by 1943–4 absorbed 50 per cent of Swiss exports, thus preventing unemployment , and provided 65 per cent of Swiss imports. However, Germany was poorly placed <a id="page_219" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>to pay for its purchases, forcing Berne to concede a further 500 million francs credit in July 1941. Thereafter, Germany began to sell gold to the National Bank, which was eager to buy because in June 1941, the United States had frozen 2 billion francs of Swiss assets, forcing the Bank to rebuild its reserves. The Bank also wanted to stop others buying gold that could then be used to buy francs and push inflation up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though the tide of war was beginning to change, fear of a German takeover remained real. At the notorious Wansee Conference of December 1942, for example, the Nazi leadership still assumed that Swiss Jews would be included in the Final Solution. In the end the National Bank bought 1.7 billion francs from Germany, including gold the Nazi regime seized from its victims; it also bought almost 3 billion francs of gold from the Allies. Dealings with the German regime continued despite Allied pressure for a cessation of Swiss trade with Germany and for acceptance of the Safehaven programme. The latter ruled out forced transfers of property, in which Switzerland was still involved.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite having very good information on German army thinking through the secret Lucy espionage network, the Swiss government – as opposed to Guisan – did not fully appreciate the extent to which Germany’s position had weakened. Indeed, in 1942 Pilet-Golaz was still thinking of offering mediation. His willingness to do so led his own intelligence services to accuse him in February 1943 of wanting a separate peace. But an effort to expel him failed, and he was re-elected that December. Economic need and continuing fears of German aggression still motivated government strategy. Such fears remained active from late 1942 well into 1943, and in fact real expectation of an attack developed in March 1943 after secret talks took place between Guisan and SS General Walter Schellenberg . The latter claimed that invasion plans had been active, and that he had helped to quash them. This was probably a fabrication, designed partly to help Schellenberg’s own interests inside the Reich and partly to maintain economic pressure on Switzerland in the face of Allied progress in North Africa. Guisan used the meeting to ram home the Swiss determination to resist any attack, a stance made plausible by the massive increase in Swiss anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns, along with an air force that had grown from 200 to 530 planes. Guisan’s <a id="page_220" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_221" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>determination was also backed up by a fully functional – and now publically discussed – Reduit and the ability to mobilize 580,000 well-trained men. The Federal Council was unhappy about the talks, however, and blocked further dealings. It also went on arresting and executing Nazi agents.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-2956"><img src="../images/00048.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">7.5 </span>One of the twenty-six major military artillery emplacements within the Reduit. The latter was not a single construction but a network of camouflaged defensive lines round the Alps involving such things as guns hidden in old barns, anti-tank barriers, mines, blockhouses and road blocks. It also included underground hangars, stockpiles and facilities like hospitals for the 385,000 men who were stationed there in 1941–3. The Reduit was developed after the war but gradually became redundant and its remnants were sold off in 2011.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Popular attitudes moved beyond the government’s caution and towards the left because of reductions in rations and the resulting poverty and social unease. In the 1943 elections, which were not postponed because of the war as they were in Britain, the Social Democrats gained an unprecedented eleven seats and again became the largest party. The victory finally enabled them to secure their first Federal Council seat for Ernst Nobs , MP, a Zurich cantonal administrator and mayor of Zurich. Unions demanded higher wages and the renewal of the Labour Peace, while Stämpfli conceded the creation of the AHV/AVS pension system, setting Switzerland on the road to a modern welfare state as well as a more consensual form of governance. Even the Communists re-emerged in 1944 as the Labour party. However, the Social Democrats were not able to secure either the direct election of Federal Councillors or the expansion, from seven to nine, of the Federal Council .</p>
<p class="calibre4">The fall of Mussolini in September 1943 renewed German concern about Switzerland, whose links with the Allies it distrusted and whose mountains could provide a means of resisting an Allied push from the south. In summer 1944, rumours came through the Swiss Viking link in Budapest that an attack was imminent. The Allied attack on D-Day made this impossible, however, and the government even refused Guisan a new mobilization. The shifting balance in the war did cause Switzerland new problems, however, problems which were to outlast the war.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-2966"><span class="title">At Odds with the Allies</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Continuing German pressure made it difficult for Switzerland to respond to the new strategic situation, and made relations with the Allies harder. Indeed, Switzerland faced increasing difficulties with the latter. Disliking what they saw as the self-interestedly strict interpretation of neutrality favoured by the Swiss, they increased their demands on Switzerland as their victories accumulated. The <a id="page_222" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>resulting alienation foreshadowed the way that, after 1945, Swiss satisfaction at having survived the war came into conflict with critical Allied attitudes. This rendered the country unable to play a full part in the new international configurations that were emerging. For example, since the United Nations was unwilling to accommodate neutrality, the country stayed out. Growing criticism from the Allies also meant that reformism began to peter out at home.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As early as 1944, the Allies were causing more difficulties for the Swiss government than the Germans were, calling on the Swiss to break all relations with the Reich while extracting new trade and gold deals after an eight-month suspension of supplies in 1944. The Swiss did not, in fact, sign any additional agreements with Germany, which was finding it harder to provide Switzerland with the coal the country so desperately needed. As an Allied victory became more likely, the government even tried to renew contacts with the USSR , but Stalin remained hostile. His rejection of Pilet-Golaz’s overtures finally forced the latter to resign in 1944. However, it was the constant overflights by Allied bombers that annoyed the Swiss the most, especially when on 1 April 1944, and apparently by mistake, the Americans bombed Schaffhausen , killing forty people and wounding many more.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By the late summer of 1944, change around Switzerland accelerated as the Allies moved closer to the Swiss borders, forcing the transfer of men from the Reduit to the north and west frontiers. Although Stalin might have liked to invade so as to use Switzerland for a further attack on Germany, there was never any question of the Allies crossing into Switzerland. Nonetheless, Allied political pressure increased: in early 1945, Roosevelt demanded that Switzerland join the Allies in their crusade against Nazism, and difficult negotiations began over art sales. Initially, the Swiss declined such demands, though they did open the frontiers a little more to refugees , and on 16 February 1945, German holdings in Switzerland were finally blocked. Yet even in March, the government, pushed by the right, refused to end trade with the Reich on the grounds that this would infringe neutrality . Indeed, Swiss banks were dealing with the Reichsbank as late as 3 May 1945, at the very time that Swiss officers were helping to end the war in Italy and refugees were again pouring into Switzerland. Swiss reluctance to change its profitable <a id="page_223" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>business-as-usual policy partly reflected an insistence on sovereignty , and partly an awareness that, even after its defeat, Germany would remain an important trading partner for Switzerland. Only as the war ended were relations with the Reich finally broken off. Church bells rang on 8 May, and the Federal Council broadcast to the nation to celebrate the way the army had ensured the country’s survival. After a final parade in Berne, active service was ended on 20 August.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Switzerland might only have lost 84 citizens dead and 260 wounded, but the war had cost it 2.3 billion francs of assets and it had suffered 70 million francs of war damage from overflying incidents. In the long term, Swiss policy towards Germany during the war would prove far more costly politically. At the end of the war, the Swiss faced what has been called ‘resentful international suspicion’. Outside opinion viewed the Confederation’s economic relations with the Reich not as necessary compromises to ensure survival, but as profiteering from cooperation with evil. Despite Churchil l’s praise, Allied opinion generally had little sympathy for neutrality . For the Americans in particular, the matter of Holocaust assets, on which the Swiss were seen as avoiding Allied controls and demands, was another major concern. The Allies demanded that all gold held by the National Bank should be returned, because it was stolen. Although the demand caused an explosion of anger in Switzerland, the Swiss had to negotiate in order to get their own assets unfrozen. They found the Allies unsatisfied by the establishment of the Judicial Chamber for Looted Assets (Kammer zu Beurteilung von Raub), the passing of a decree on such assets in December 1945 and the Currie agreement of March 1945.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Finally, after very tough negotiations, the Swiss government accepted the Washington Agreement of 25 May 1946, in which it agreed to liquidate German assets and pay half of the 250 million francs realized to the Allies. The latter accepted this action as satisfying all their claims, and unfroze Swiss assets. The British and French were won over partly by a generous loan the Swiss government provided towards their rebuilding costs. None of this prevented further wrangling over implementation and the exchange rates used in the settlement. Switzerland also promised to identify holders of abandoned accounts in Swiss banks , but undertook no serious efforts to do so. Moreover, there was no question of Switzerland joining the United Nations , given that the Charter did not provide for <a id="page_224" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>neutrality and there was little support domestically for entry. However, it did become an Observer, and allowed the United Nations to use the old League buildings in Geneva. Switzerland also stayed out of UNRRA, GATT and the Bretton Woods institutions, because the latter’s founding document criticized neutrals who had traded with the Axis . Only later did it join the OEEC, the International Court of Justice and UNESCO.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The initial post-war stand-off began to ease as Swiss anti-communism found a new place in the widening Cold War divide. The Cold War also provided a new opening for neutrality , so that within a few years Switzerland was able to accept a mediating role in the Korean War. Switzerland even received a limited amount of Marshall Plan aid. The government’s stance reflected a new policy <a id="page_225" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>of ‘neutrality and solidarity’ adumbrated in 1947 by Max Petitpierre , Pilet-Golaz’s successor as foreign minister. Since the United Nations would not provide for Swiss neutrality, he sought to give the policy a new dimension by playing up neutrality’s humanitarian and universalist elements. Switzerland under his guidance joined bodies like UNICEF, despite some reservations at home, and established diplomatic relations with the USSR , Israel and China.</p>

He came to receive an honorary degree from the University and, surprisingly, the neutral Swiss turned out in thousands to congratulate him, both in the streets, as seen in this triumphal parade through rainy Zurich, and in the Münsterhof. His speech in the University Aula, ‘Let Europe Arise’, which urged Franco-German reconciliation and the creation of a United States of Europe, was a turning point in the history of Western Europe, if not in that of Switzerland.</div>
<p class="calibre4">The Swiss reaction to the beginnings of Europe an integration remained ambiguous. In 1946, the Swiss offered Churchill an enthusiastic welcome for his idea of Franco-German reconciliation, and issued their own Hertenstein Declaration in favour of a European federation . Swiss intellectuals like Denis de Rougemont were active in the early federalist movement, but the government was much more reserved and stayed out of the Council of Europe on its foundation in 1949, out of fear of its supranational political ambitions. Likewise, Switzerland only joined the European Payments Union after gaining assurances that it could opt out of decisions of which it disapproved. The country also ignored critical voices about its wartime role, notably from Judge Max Wolff, and became increasingly defensive. Calls for a purge of the army were ignored, and no formal response to Guisan ’s ‘Report on Active Service ’ of 1947 was ever published. The Report reinforced what many Swiss felt about their experience, and began to give the war a myth ical status, on which they were to build over the next forty years by stressing the <span class="italic">Activdienst</span> (active service) while underplaying the significance of relations with Germany .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before then, the hostile atmosphere and difficult negotiations at war’s end had an impact on domestic politics by undermining solidarity and reformism. However, family allowances were approved in December 1945 and AVS came into being in January 1948, defeating a popular challenge to do so. Economic Articles including consultation and government economic powers were passed, legitimating the state’s new policy shift towards a welfare state. But a Right to Work Initiative was defeated, and in 1947 the Social Democrats lost seats. The restoration of the right to challenge ‘urgent’ legislation only narrowly scraped through. National solidarity faced an explosion of separatism in the Bernese Jura after German-speakers blocked the election of a French-speaker to the key Transport portfolio. As before, the Ticinese demanded special treatment.</p>
<a id="page_226" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Many ordinary Swiss also felt that their sacrifices during the war were not appreciated, despite having, through the army, maintained independence and neutrality against Nazism, as well as providing a haven for refugees and preserving internal cohesion. Critical outside judgements were not understood, let alone accepted. The Swiss perspective emphasized that the nation had maintained its unity, overcoming both linguistic and social divides, while the Swiss government was moving away from its earlier conservatism towards a more interventionist role. In the Swiss view, their institutions had enabled Switzerland to stay out of two wars, even though those wars and a major depression had undermined the nation’s prosperity. The post-war combination of external criticism and domestic tensions thus encouraged the continuation of a hedgehog mentality and valorization of Swiss distinctiveness in a rapidly changing world, especially in conservative quarters. The hedgehog wartime experience of many Swiss, in which they had seen off slump and war, became a vital basis for developing a new self-confidence based on the conviction that Switzerland had become a special case – the so-called Swiss <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740"><span class="italic">Sonderfall</span></a></span> – even though outside opinion was far from sharing Swiss assessments.</p>
