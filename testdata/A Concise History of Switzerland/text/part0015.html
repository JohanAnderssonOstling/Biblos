<p class="noindent">The Peace of Aarau and the fourth <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3727">Landfrieden</a></span> revised the religious balance in Switzerland to the benefit of the Protestant cantons, but left undisturbed the rigid patrician oligarchies within the cantons. As outsiders noted, the country remained as stable and as complicated a Europe an fixture as ever, but, while other Western states were modernizing their armies and governance, the Swiss political class did not follow suit, and so became increasingly passive participants in international affairs and less flexible and accommodating at home. In fact, the peace enabled the patricians to consolidate what can be called the Swiss Ancien Régime : a congeries of stable urban and rural oligarchies, relatively prosperous but increasingly inflexible and repressive. All this encouraged stasis.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Stasis intensified despite the fact that the oligarchic regimes experienced repeated challenges, often from ordinary people who felt the patricians were breaking older conventions and undertakings, but also from within patrician circles by those influenced by Enlightenment thinking, which was one of many European trends in which the cantons shared. Slow but steady internal change – often pushed by members of elite families or by ambitious individuals from the edges of the elite – also threatened the existing order. And, despite growing oligarchical resistance to change from the 1770s, economic growth over the following two decades generated further pressures at the very time that the French Revolution encouraged new forms of protest. Ultimately, the Ancien Régime ’s increasing rigidities and its promotion of cantonal over confederal interests made it impossible for the old Confederacy to survive in the face of French invasion.</p>
<a id="page_105" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><h3 class="sec" id="c19444-1342"><span class="title">Stability and Challenges</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the immediate aftermath of the Villmergen War, it was not at all certain that the Peace would hold. Although relatively moderate, it was bitterly opposed by the Catholic cantons because, along with giving Berne and Zurich a more proportionate share in the administration of the condominiums of Aargau and Thurgau , it also formalized religious parity for the Confederacy’s subjects. Instead of interfering with rights of worship, it provided new processes for mediation of disputes. The Peace also ended the practice of dual Diets , although the Catholics refused to meet in Baden , from which they had just been excluded. Thereafter the Diet met in Frauenfeld with each faith providing its own secretary to draw up its acts.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The new settlement was soon secretly challenged when, in May 1715, the Catholic cantons renewed their old Golden League alliance and their treaty with France. To the latter was added a secret protocol, kept hidden in a trunk – hence its nickname of the <span class="italic">Trücklibund</span> – in which France promised to mediate in case of disputes with Protestants so as to assist the Catholics to restore their lost prerogatives. While this was never acted on, it symbolized Catholic resentments, feelings that lingered into the 1770s. Yet these never threatened to break up the Confederacy , partly because the surrounding powers did not want this, and partly because the old order was consistently held together by the collective self-interest of its elites, which cut across the religious divide.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Persistent resentments helped, in other words, to prevent any rapid change to the ramshackle constitutional structures of the Confederacy and its subject territories. It remained a contractual system based on a network of treaties, respect for the established order and multiple layers of privilege. Hence the Diet was little more than a symbol and a means of socialization, lacking army, finance and a proper administration as it did. Indeed, if anything, the Diet became even less active at this time because of the need to meet in private and refer all decisions back to the cantons. The joke circulated that the Diet would not agree that snow fell in winter without asking for instructions. Even when decisions were finally reached, cantons were not obliged to act on them.</p>
<a id="page_106" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Certainly there was never sufficient agreement to admit Geneva as a full member, as suggested in 1734, or to modernize the Confederacy as was occasionally proposed. Religious disagreements also prevented renewal of the 1663 alliance with France , because the Protestant cantons refused French persuasion and were less active in supplying mercenaries , making room for more regiments from Catholic cantons like Zug and Solothurn . Nonetheless, France remained a dominant influence in Swiss politics throughout the century, further curtailing the role of confederal decision-making, and encouraging both sides to hold on to authority in their cantons. The French link thus helped to consolidate stability and rigidity as well as power.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In both confessional camps, power remained firmly in the hands of the one group, the so-called patriciates , who through their control of supposedly representative institutions enjoyed monopolies over mercenary recruitment, economic activity, land and office. In fact the patriciates became even more restrictive, closing off access to economic opportunities as well as to citizenship and public office and consolidating oligarchic al regimes. In Fribourg only three families were allowed to join the patriciate between 1627 and 1782. By 1734, a third of the Genevan Conseil des Deux Cents came from just ten families, while the Bernese <span class="italic">Gnädige Herren</span> (Gracious Lords), as they were known, became increasingly cut off from their growing and hard-pressed rural population. The successful investments that the <span class="italic">Gnädige Herren</span> made in British shares and government funds, together with their monopoly of the fifty lucrative posts as bailiffs in the subject territories, meant that they were decreasingly reliant on taxes for state income. Increasingly, the elites of cities like Berne and Lucerne  came to think of their rule as equivalent to the self-governing cities of the ancient world, while they also took on the role of the heirs of William Tell . Their self-regard is evident in both the palatial country mansions they erected and the imposing, albeit self-satisfied portraits that grace those houses. Such regimes became increasingly acquisitive, bureaucratic and monopolistic. Thus, the Etats de Vaud met for the last time in 1739, just as elections were being phased out in the Inner Rhoden of Appenzell and in Neuchâtel .</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1376"><img src="../images/00027.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">4.1 </span>Waldegg Castle. The Chateau in the Catholic canton of Solothurn is a magnificent example of patrician display belonging to the Besenval family, the richest and most powerful in the canton in the eighteenth century. Their wealth and power came from the pensions provided by service in the French <span class="italic">Gardes Suisses</span> and a salt monopoly. The family was one of the leaders of the French party in Switzerland, being intimately connected to the French royal family and its wars.</div>
<p class="calibre4">This trend did not go unchallenged. In fact the oligarchies were often suspected of abusing their powers and breaking what were <a id="page_107" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>popularly seen as the old established rules as they sought to intensify their control and extraction of resources from the population. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the government of Zurich thus found itself at loggerheads both with its guilds , who objected to the failure to consult them over the decision to go to war at Villmergen , and with the town of Winterthur . The latter objected to new restrictions on its economic activities, as did Wilchingen when Schaffhausen imposed a city monopoly on inns on its territory. In Glarus , a stand-off between the authorities and the bailiwick of Werdenberg arose when the former cancelled peasant rights to forest use and pasturage. The locals demanded to see the documents on which the authorities based their claim. Peasants and subjects too looked back to the past and, like the elites, thought in terms of traditional privileges rather than modern rights.</p>
<a id="page_108" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">The most unusual episode came in the Bernese subject territory of the Vaud in late March 1723. Abraham Davel , a 53-year-old notary and major commanding the Lavaux region, ordered his militiamen to march on Lausanne and demand an end to Bernese domination. He objected to the way Berne sold church positions and forced the rigidly conservative <span class="italic">Formula Consensus</span> of 1675 on unwilling Vaudois clergy. Being naïve, he was tricked into surrendering and hastily executed. The authorities tried to conceal his list of demands but these, along with his stoicism on the scaffold, made him something of a hero in the longer term.</p>
<p class="calibre4">More commonly, conflicts of the 1720s and 1730s arose from factional struggles within the elite for control over the sinews of oligarchic power. Appenzell Outer Rhoden and Zug saw bitter struggles between the ‘hards ’ – or opposition parties – and the governing ‘softs’. In the former, the Wetter family of Herisau ousted the ‘softs’, the previously dominant aristocratic clan headed by the Zellwegers of Trogen. The latter were then prosecuted because of their stance over customs disputes with St Gallen and the powers of the Landsgemeinde. At issue in Zug was control of the French pensions paid to mercenary officers. The Schumacher family and the ‘hards’ made an abortive attempt to end the monopoly on pensions and salt supply enjoyed by the Francophile Zurlaubens and their ‘soft’ faction. With considerable sums of money at stake, the conflict nearly led to civil war, and cost one Schumacher his life.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1400"><img src="../images/00028.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">4.2 </span>Fortifications of Geneva. Because of its geographical and political position, on the borders of Savoy and France and only an ally, not a full member, of the Confederacy, the city was always at risk of attack. Hence by 1727 it had erected these very strong defences, modelled on the ideas of Vauban. Later proposals to extend the fortifications played a part in developing internal Genevan dissensions.</div>
<p class="calibre4">The divide between the elite and the masses was at its sharpest in the allied city of Geneva. Authority there was in the hands of the ‘citizens’ or ‘nobles’, a select group distinct from the ordinary bourgeois who increasingly monopolized both political power and access to the professions. Their attempts to refortify the city against threats which no longer seemed real triggered a revolt in the 1730s, because this meant new tax burdens on the already downtrodden ‘habitants’, mainly post-Revocation arrivals for whom access to the bourgeoisie was no longer possible. At best their offspring, if born in the city, could become ‘natifs’, who had few rights but were allowed to share the tax burden. Although by the 1720s habitants made up 50 per cent of the population, their situation was increasingly difficult and politically deprived. In fact, prior to 1767 only ninety people were admitted to citizenship, and then only after paying large sums.</p>
<a id="page_109" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">  The actual complaint behind the  1730s troubles was that the new levies had not been submitted for approval to the Conseil Général, the open assembly of the entire bourgeoisie. This break in traditional republican practice caused both protests from the bourgeoisie and popular agitation. When the oligarchs found their troops being disarmed by the bourgeois militia, Berne , Zurich and France had to send in troops and impose the French -guaranteed Mediation of 1738. This, at the cost of minor changes, allowed the ‘citizen’ oligarchy to maintain its position over the next twenty years. The oligarchy , in fact, was willing to accept virtual French domination as long as its own powers were not threatened. This reflected the way they were increasingly becoming a European elite.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Similarly, in the Bishopric of Basle, trouble began after 1726 when the Bishop attempted to end the peasantry ’s rights of free pasturage <a id="page_110" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>while also increasing taxation. The resulting tax strike and disorders forced the Bishop, who could get neither Berne nor the Catholic cantons to bail him out, to sign a secret treaty with France , whose troops intervened in the 1740s to put down the revolt. As well as a defence of traditional social privileges against enclosures and economic modernization, the revolt was also a challenge to established episcopal authority. When Pierre Péquinat, one of the ringleaders, was executed in 1740, he too eventually became a symbol of liberation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before then, Switzerland as a whole was affected by the series of mid-century European wars. In 1734, the Protestant cantons offered troops to guard the frontiers when the War of Polish Succession threatened the Rhine. During the War of Austrian Succession, when neutrality was formally declared, troops had to be provided to defend Geneva when it was threatened by Spanish forces campaigning nearby. Such large-scale wars also affected the mercenary business. Combatant states demanded more control and more training for Swiss troops, so as to make use of new technologies. In 1734 this forced the Swiss to revise their regulations concerning mercenary capitulations. The rising death rate at battles such as Laufeld in 1747, together with poor rates of pay and harsher discipline, made mercenary service less attractive. It became harder to recruit outside the poorest regions, and desertion was not uncommon. This meant Swiss military entrepreneurs ’ profits began to fall. The French, in particular, baulked at paying a premium for Swiss regiments especially if, as was often the case, 30 per cent of their strength was not actually Swiss.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The declining appeal of mercenary service also reflected the country’s growing prosperity. The recovery of population growth after the end of the so-called Little Ice Age <span class="italic">c</span>. 1730, accelerated by better hygiene and the better diet provided by the increasing use of the potato, was a key factor. It pushed the number of Swiss well beyond the 1.2 million of the beginning of the century. The construction of new roads, notably by the Bernese, helped to break down subsistence economies and create a more effective market. Another factor was the spread of cotton spinning and weaving, often initially introduced to help the poor, which became well entrenched in Geneva and Zurich . From the latter, new textile manufactures spread into <a id="page_111" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Glarus and other parts of eastern Switzerland. Organized on the putting-out system – in which merchants took materials to contracted households to be spun or woven and then collected, made up and sold on as finished products – rural manufacturing began to provide significant income for peasant families. In the same period, watch manufacturing began to spread out of Geneva , where it had usurped the place of silk, and into the Jura region.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1435"><img src="../images/00029.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">4.3 </span>The execution of Samuel Henzi. Writer, teacher, soldier, librarian and administrator, Henzi was one of those who challenged the Swiss Ancien Régime. He was put to death with two others outside the city on 17 July 1749 for his part in a conspiracy against the Bernese oligarchy. His execution was symbolic both of patrician regimes’ refusal to countenance any criticism of the status quo, and of the way in which such executions could strengthen opposition forces.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Yet economic recovery did not end political challenges. In Berne , the heart of the Ancien Régime , some of the artisanal families who had increasingly been excluded from power began to publish pamphlets demanding restoration of the rights of guilds and people, as laid down in 1384, leading to some of them being exiled in 1744. On returning from exile in 1749, one of them, Samuel Henzi , whose military career had already been hindered because he was not an aristocrat, lost out to an unqualified young patrician for the position of state librarian. This led him to join a plot to overthrow the regime by force and replace it with a guild system. The plan was quickly betrayed and Henzi and others were executed. Many more were <a id="page_112" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>exiled and stripped of their civic rights, which discouraged the discontented from further challenges. However, Lessing wrote a play about the incident, and a posthumous play by Henzi, based on the Tell legend, was published, ensuring that the affair was not forgotten.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Six years later, in the Leventina Valley , the Uri authorities’ efforts to reform the corrupt but much-used system of wardships caused a considerable commotion. While the protestors wanted to negotiate, news of the trouble had already reached Uri , which with its allies mobilized 2,000 troops and sent them south. In face of such pressure, the dissidence subsided peacefully. The leaders were nonetheless executed and the locals were forced to take a new oath of allegiance. Though this affair later became a symbol of Ticinese liberty, it seems to have been as much a matter of poor communications as of revolt. Certainly it did not discourage the Ticinesi from supporting their trans-Alpine masters in the 1790s. Indeed, generally speaking the conservative early-century challenges were fended off without too much difficulty.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-1446"><span class="title">Intellectual Change and Patriotic Awakening</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">However, the general conservatism of the Swiss elites did not always apply to their intellectual pursuits, either generally or in thinking about Swiss history . Hence the country took a growing, if ambiguous, cultural role in Europe . It also developed a nascent national movement, parallel to that emerging in other parts of Europe. In fact, despite a successful willingness to repress, the ruling elites of eighteenth-century Switzerland were surprisingly open to intellectual change – though this was to prove subversive of the social and cantonal status quo. Many patricians were highly educated and cultured, even though Switzerland had only one university , meaning that many were forced to look to Germany for higher education . They were often advanced thinkers and very much in the Europe an mainstream. Swiss savants took leading positions in fields such as theology, philosophy, natural science, medicine, international law and historiography . Basle was strong in mathematics with the Bernoulli brothers and Euler. Zurich could boast of Johann Kaspar <a id="page_113" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> Lavater , who was to become one of the fathers of modern psychology, and of Breitinger and Bodmer , two leading figures in German literature and history. In 1734, Bodmer published Tschudi ’s <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> and argued against the idea that Switzerland had been a revolutionary creation. Two years earlier, Albrecht von Haller , a Bernese polymath, published his ground-breaking poem on the Alps, which was to stimulate admiration of mountains and the lifestyle they produced.</p>
<p class="calibre4">All this helped to develop political awareness across Swiss society. With censorship beginning to ebb, newspapers like the <span class="italic">Mercure Suisse</span> of 1732 began to emerge. Colporteurs travelled the countryside with pamphlets, while towns saw a growing number of reading societies , coffee houses, salons and schools , all of which helped stimulate public debate. Even more important were the growing number of learned societies , such as that of Public Utility, founded in 1737, the Economic and Statistical Society of 1760 and a number of Agricultural Societies.</p>
<p class="calibre4">These developments helped Switzerland become something of an entrepôt for English ideas and a required stage on the Grand Tour, especially as Swiss intellectual life was less anti-clerical than that in France. It was partly for such reasons that Edward Gibbon was sent to Lausanne in the 1750s. Another intellectual dynamic came from the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau , who was both a citizen of Geneva and had many contacts with Neuchâtel . Voltaire also became an admirer of things Swiss, and took up residence on the borders of Geneva, where many of his works were published. As a result, the country found itself at the heart of new religious and intellectual controversies. The printing of the <span class="italic">Encyclopédie</span>, along with much other Enlightenment literature, at Yverdon in the 1770s meant that the country played a major part in disseminating French ideas as well. Geneva, Lausanne and Neuchâtel also became important publishing centres. Increasingly Switzerland mattered intellectually to Europe while many Britons, like Gibbon, were attracted by its political arrangements.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the later eighteenth century, Swiss society became more tolerant, with executions for heresy and witch craft gradually ceasing and torture coming under attack. This tolerance was often helpful to women, who became more able to contribute to social life. In fact, <a id="page_114" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> the first Swiss school for women was set up in Zurich in 1774, suggesting that attitudes were becoming marginally less restrictive than in the past. Lower-class women may also have benefited from new opportunities in the putting-out industries.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, neither this tolerance nor their cultural interests stopped patricians from seeking to quash ideas that they considered subversive – and much of the Enlightenment was indeed corrosive of the foundations of oligarchical rule. Hence, those who were felt to have stepped out of line, like the Neuchâtel pastor Ferdinand-Olivier Petitpierre, who in 1755 preached that damnation might not be eternal, were sacked and forced into exile. In 1762 Petitpierre was joined in England by the noted artist Henry Fuseli, who was forced to leave Zurich after joining with Lavater and Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi , the well-known educational theorist, in criticism of a corrupt bailiff. A few years later, Pastor Christoph Müller was forced to flee the city after publicly defending Genevan-style democracy .</p>
<p class="calibre4">When, in 1761, Pastor Freudenberg showed that, as many had suspected, the legend of Tell shooting the apple off his son’s head had originated in Denmark, his book was burnt by outraged Uri authorities. They did not like any challenge to their Tell founding myth, as Gibbon was well aware when he decided to set aside his planned history of Switzerland. Johannes von Müller had to pretend that his highly influential romantic <span class="italic">History of Switzerland</span>, which circulated from the 1780s and talked about Tell, was published in Massachusetts in order to avert criticism from Bernese officials who saw Tell as a revolutionary. Nonetheless, Freudenberg’s discovery prompted a real debate and a search for proof. In contrast, the rediscovery in 1758 of the 1291 compact by Johann Heinrich Gleser , a young lecturer turned baker, had little impact on historical thinking until later. Most Swiss followed the liberation saga as set out in the fifteenth-century chronicles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite the hazards, many Swiss intellectuals were drawn towards thinking about their own Swiss identity and asking what held them together despite their linguistic and religious differences. The late 1750s saw the publication of a number of introspective writings, such the <span class="italic">Patriotic Dreams</span> of both Franz Urs Balthasar from Lucerne and Isaak Iselin from Basle. The latter was historian, philosopher and critic both of Rousseau and of Switzerland’s mercantile <a id="page_115" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>and aristocratic spirit. Balthasar and others were even more critical of the state of the Confederacy, the former proposing a federal college, a unified army and a confederal tax to remedy its weaknesses. More than in previous centuries, intellectuals now thought of Switzerland as a single nation, though one sorely lacking in political unity. Folk songs and the increasing interest in the mountains helped to further the idea of distinct Swiss and Alpine identity .</p>
<p class="calibre4">From the early 1760s, such thinking was focused on the Helvetic Society , which began meeting at Schinznach in Aargau in 1762. Inspired by Iselin, the society sought to bring the cantons together and to overcome the religious divide by appealing to Swiss patriotism through a glorification of Swiss exploits in the Middle Ages. Attracting some 400 members, mainly professional men but even including a few women , the society was mostly critical of the Ancien Régime , since its members sought to modernize Switzerland and see it profit from general European economic growth on physiocratic lines. Politically, Iselin saw Switzerland as a free state, but one in need of unification. Hence, like Balthasar before him in 1744, he drafted a model Swiss constitution. The Society’s failure to offer unblemished support for the existing order meant it also faced attacks from conservative elites. Hence, after 1766, it was forced to moderate its tone and become less critical. More dramatically, the Bernese Economic Society, which was critical of mercenary service for corrupting the country and limiting population growth and agriculture, was forced to shut down by the authorities. Nonetheless, Helvetianism remained a significance intellectual force and, in time, was to help call the Ancien Régime into question and provide a basis for more national thinking, in part by encouraging people to look to Swiss history as a basis for unity.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-1504"><span class="title">Contradictory Trends at Mid-Century</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Around this time, the Ancien Régime was also shaken by economic disruption and the way that questions related to mercenary service caused internal conflicts and new tensions with France. While a new treaty eventually emerged, none of this encouraged the Confederacy to modernize, despite the example offered by enlightened despotism in neighbouring countries. As with cultural developments, <a id="page_116" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Switzerland’s mid-century political difficulties clearly owed much to accelerating economic change, which in turn began to threaten the social basis of the Ancien Régime . In fact, agricultur al development accelerated as land became more expensive, leading to more intensive and commercial farming; artificial fertilizers came in by the 1770s, along with new root crops. Commercial cheese production for distant markets spread further into the midlands , leading some peasants to switch from cereals into dairying; cheese sales made some quite wealthy, despite their increasing dependence on the market. More and more Swiss peasants also came to own their own land, especially in the mountains.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1513"><img src="../images/00030.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">4.4 </span>Fabrique Neuve de Cortaillod in Neuchâtel. The factory opened in 1752 in this elegant classical building, replacing an earlier cotton workshop. In its time, it was the country’s biggest and most modern textile factory, employing 700 workers. Powered by water, it produced 45,000 cloths a year, which it sold throughout Europe. Although badly hit by the British blockade during the Napoleonic Wars, it remained in operation until 1854.</div>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1514"><img src="../images/00031.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">4.5 </span>Nineteenth-century painting by Karl Jauslin depicting the open-air political banquet held at Jordils, near Ouchy, to celebrate the second anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. Local notables are shown wearing revolutionary cockades, toasting the French Revolution and generally having a good time. Attracting more than 150 people, the actual banquet involved toasts to liberty and the États de Vaud. This and other banquets, notably at Rolle the following day, moved the Bernese oligarchy to crack down, banning such meetings and forcing the Vaudois to seek a formal pardon, thereby worsening relations with their Francophone subjects. Hence many see the banquets as stepping stones to the independence of Vaud at the end of the decade.</div>
<p class="calibre4">The growing population also provided labour for the growing domestic industries in the smaller towns and villages of German-speaking Switzerland. The year 1750 also saw the opening of the Fabrique Neuve de Cortaillod in Neuchâtel , one of the biggest textile <a id="page_117" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>centres in the country. Growth was encouraged by the expanding trade with France after the 1740s. Geneva merchants also increased their involvement in colonial trade , something that helped to encourage bankers such as Necker , whose firm flourished after the Seven Years War had ended. These developments began to create and spread wealth, allowing for its display at a more popular level, despite continuing sumptuary legislation by the big-city elites. Indeed, by the 1770s, concerns about pauperism began to fade. Only in the Ticinese hills and the Engadine did substantial numbers still have to resort to seasonal migration .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Prosperity did not prevent further political disorders around mid-century. The most significant troubles came in Geneva after 1762, when the government ordered the burning of Rousseau’s <span class="italic">Émile</span> and <span class="italic">The Social Contract</span> because they were subversive. Intellectuals and many locals objected and, in 1763, a formal ‘representation’ or address to the authorities was made, complaining that neither Rousseau nor the Consistory had been heard before the burning. The government refused either to accept the representation or to allow it to be taken to the Conseil Général. Hence, many of the middling classes began to demand the legal right to present such petitions, creating a new opposition movement, nicknamed the ‘Representants’. A pamphlet war with the patricians ensued, to which Voltaire began to contribute. A mediation attempt by Berne and other cantons was rejected by the Conseil Général because it wholly backed the patricians, whose theatre was burned in protest. Although an Edict of Conciliation allowing the Representants new rights was agreed on in 1768, following a French blockade, their unsuccessful resort to further violence led to its revocation two years later and forced some opposition leaders into exile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In Neuchâte l, problems began in the mid-1750s, caused by Frederick II of Prussia ’s attempts to apply some of the dictums of Enlightened Despotism to his far-off principality, notably selling off tax collection rights to the highest-bidding group of so-called tax farmers. In 1766, this attracted real anger when, following a failure to attract bids, the authorities tried to sell off state lands, which the locals saw as a breach of promises made to them in 1707. Frederick then appealed to Berne, which found in his favour and, when unrest persisted, mobilized 9,000 men, apparently cowing the city into <a id="page_118" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>submission. But when Frederick nominated Claude Gaudot – his main defender but formerly a member of the opposition – as lieutenant governor, anger flared up again, and Gaudot was murdered in April 1768. The town was then reduced to obedience.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the Catholic and Landsgemeinde cantons, questions of foreign policy and mercenary service generated numerous internal disputes. In the Inner Rhoden of Appenzell in 1760, a popular innkeeper called Suter was elected <span class="italic">Vogt</span> , but soon fell out with the moneyed elites and the monasteries. Exiled in 1775, he was executed in 1784 for challenging the big families’ control of the Landsgemeinde . In Lucerne, as part of the long-running struggle between the Meyer and Schumacher families, Placide Schumacher, the cantonal Registrar, was executed in 1764 for alleged treason. He had tried to raise a popular revolt after his relatives had been condemned for malversation. He also opposed both the Trücklibund and reform of mercenary service. A member of the aristocratic Meyer family was also exiled, and his writings burnt, because he sought to limit the power of the Church.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In Schwyz , trouble sprang from the way in which the Duc de Choiseul , French foreign minister after the disasters of the Seven Years War and Colonel-General of the Swiss, had, for reasons of economy, cut the number of Swiss-supplied regiments. When his actions provoked opposition, he disbanded the Schwyz regiments and withheld vital supplies of salt . Disorder also arose over tax questions in the outlying March and Einsiedeln districts. Lieutenant-General Josef Nazar Reding brought the disbanded troops home and unsuccessfully sought to mediate. He was seen as too favourable to the French, however, and was forced to flee. Choiseul’s changes also caused trouble in Zug , where a ‘soft ’ leader was forced to flee after opposition developed to his attempts to monopolize the mercenary and salt trades. Not till 1764 did all cantons accept the new French rules, allowing Reding to return safely to office.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Little of this political strife really involved the Diet, which remained an impotent bystander, unable to take decisions because Berne and Zurich were still resolutely opposed to French mercenary contacts. This changed only in the mid-1770s when Joseph II of Austria emerged as a worse threat than France, since Joseph’s <a id="page_119" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>participation in the First Partition of Poland seemed to suggest he might want to reclaim the long-lost Habsburg territories of Aargau and Thurgau . Positions also shifted with the arrival of a new and more trusted King, in Louis XVI, whose ministers finally realized that the Protestant cantons could not be separated. A new fifty-year deal was signed on 28 May 1777, allowing France to go on recruiting mercenaries, but implicitly annulling the Trücklibund and nominally replacing French mediation by domestic agreements. A Plan of Protection was drawn up to enable the latter to be negotiated, but was never implemented, so strong were local particularisms and religious suspicions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Equally, the Diet refused to respond to the demands for military reform made by the Helvetic Military Society in 1779. Reforms were clearly necessary, given the way that military exercises had to be cancelled in Fribourg in 1762 after incompetent gunners set their own roofs on fire. The Confederacy thus remained a weak body, lacking a constitution, an army and a reliable tax- based income. Far from being a state comparable to its more powerful reforming neighbours, it remained self-satisifiedly dependent on an implicit French guarantee, which in turn depended on a balance of power that had turned against France following its defeats in the Seven Years War. Hence the suggestion made by Johann Georg Stokar, a chairman of the Helvetic Society , that the country needed to unify and accept equal rights for all, was ignored. Indeed, things were already going in the opposite direction.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-1559"><span class="title">Oligarchic Reaction and Economic Transformation</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Faced with such emerging challenges, the patriciate ignored them and sought to move in a reactionary direction, in line with what some historians think was happening in France. While this was initially successful, it failed to cope with intensifying internal troubles or with the increasing socio-economic power of the politically excluded. In fact, the Swiss patriciate after 1770 seems to have been moving away from a mainly defensive stance towards more purposive efforts to fortify their position. Refusing ideas of unification was, in other words, symptomatic of the oligarchies’ approach in the 1770s and <a id="page_120" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>1780s. Going beyond immediate challenges, the oligarchs sought aggressively to entrench their positions and interests at the expense of lesser breeds, something that prompted very significant risings in Geneva and Fribourg . At the same time, proto-industrialization was expanding rapidly, enough that some scholars see this period as the beginning of the Swiss economic ‘take-off’ surge. Rural manufactures were often organized by political outsiders and took place outside the capital cities, making the political weight of the countryside increasingly significant. The hegemony of the restricted urban elites was at stake.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The epitome of the new oligarchical push was the 1773 decision in Lucerne to reduce the number of ruling families to twenty-nine. Only if one family actually died out, henceforth, could another be brought in. At the same time, the Meyer faction was banished because it sought an end to confessional politics. In Uri , the powers of the Landsgemeinde were curbed to the benefit of three major families, who also arrogated to themselves a monopoly over the vital transit trade . In Berne , the number of ruling families dwindled to sixty-eight, while only 3,600 out of a total population of 200,000 could play any part in politics, compared to 5,700 of 215,000 in Zurich, where only eighty-six families could hold office. In Basle , though there were many citizens, real power was limited to fifty-eight families, three more than in Solothurn . Overall, the patriciate in the late eighteenth century numbered some 10,000, in a population of about 1.7 million.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As the patriciates shrank, they also became more aristocratic. In Berne and Fribourg, families were allowed to use the particle ‘von’, which denoted noble status, while in Thurgau and elsewhere, the patricians redefined themselves as noble. Many elites also sought to tighten their control over their <span class="italic">Hintersassen</span> , the non-citizen subjects, by restricting crafts to urban artisans, by limiting the putting-out system and by rescinding rurals’ ability to enroll in mercenary and other services. Although oligarchs also refused political rights to the lower orders in the capital cities, they were able to keep them satisfied by granting them economic privileges. This increasing discrimination was to have a lasting and destabilizing effect on Swiss politics over the next fifty years.</p>
<a id="page_121" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">The first signs of instability came in May 1781 in Fribourg , when the government tried to cut twenty-seven feast days, shut down a monastery notable for helping the poor and sought to tax livestock. Dissatisfaction amongst sharecroppers was channelled by Pierre-Nicolas Chenaux, a charismatic but ruined farmer-cum-businessman from the Gruyère region, who had been denied promotion in the militia because he was not a patrician. He joined in a plot being hatched in Bulle to march on and occupy the capital. Though the government got wind of this, Chenaux was still able to raise 3,000 men and advance on Fribourg. His attempts at negotiation failed when Bernese military assistance arrived. Most of the rebels surrendered without a fight, while Chenaux himself was killed by another rebel turned bounty hunter. Although even Berne urged concessions, fierce repression followed. However, the countryside was invited to make known its complaints, mainly about tax ation, while the urban middle classes called for change. But the only changes carried out actually relaxed the restrictions on noble families by allowing their children to hold office, along with a slight widening of the patriciate. Many of those who protested were forced into exile in 1783.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In Geneva , a further wave of troubles resulted from a new offensive by the most reactionary amongst the elite, the so-called ‘Constitutionnaires’, who had never accepted the reforms of 1768. Having gained a majority in the governing councils at the end of the 1770s, they were able to block the codification of the city’s numerous laws that the 1768 agreement required. This greatly annoyed the ‘Representants’. Both sides began to pamphlet and mobilize their followers, causing street scuffles. The reformers gained the upper hand early in 1781 and passed the Bienfaisant Edict, which bestowed new rights on the <span class="italic">natifs</span>, committed the city to regular acceptance of new citizens and abolished some feudal dues. The unhappy mediating powers ordered that elections should not be held, but the government ignored them. It did annul the Bienfaisant Edict, however, prompting a massive popular rising in April 1782, followed by an opposition purge of the Councils and the government. But, when the powers responded by investing the city, the radical leaders had to yield. Many of them fled abroad, allowing France and Savoy to institute a White Terror of their own.</p>
<a id="page_122" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4"> Such victories won the patriciates a few more years of unchallenged peace, but these were not used to institute reforms that could have helped them cope with rapidly changing circumstances at home and abroad. The authoritarian oligarchs continued to see no need to adapt. They preferred to rely for their legitimacy on custom, heredity and closeness to an established church. Indeed, they saw themselves as a divinely ordained elite at the peak of a hierarchical society. In this they eschewed the newer representative ideas emerging in the Anglo-American world in favour of continental traditions of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yet Swiss society was itself changing fast. From about 1780 Switzerland underwent what Rappard and others have called a real industrial revolution, based at first on the putting-out system but quickly expanding into factory production. By 1790, a quarter of the population , which would soon reach 1.7 million, was dependent on manufacturing, three quarters of these in the textile industry, which already employed 90,000. Although Sonderegger introduced mechanized spinning to Herisau in the early 1780s, mechanization accelerated after 1795, as competition from British mechanized textile production made itself felt. Output grew enormously, both in cotton and in watches, of which some 50,000 a year were being turned out in Geneva alone. Neuchâtel had some 3,500 watch makers by the end of the century. Much of the expansion in textiles was financed by master weavers, not by banks, showing that the new economy was making some employers increasingly wealthy. However, bankers also saw the attractiveness of textiles and began to invest in the sector. Trade also flourished and moved into new areas, with some Swiss even engaged in the slave trade . The midlands and its new cheese makers increasingly dominated agriculture .</p>
<p class="calibre4">This transformation created a dual challenge to the patriciates . On the one hand, economic dynamism was moving away from capital cities, where the oligarchs were mainly based, to rural areas and outlying towns. The latter grew rapidly in size and number, so that at least forty-two towns reached a population of over 2000 by the end of the 1790s. Outlying areas thus counted for much more than in the past. On the other hand, industrialization produced and promoted new middle classes who were better off, more educated and increasingly politically aware. Some were large-scale commercial <a id="page_123" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>farmers, others textile entrepreneurs, and many more were hand workers. Their emergence had increasing political effects, such as movements against corruption in Zug and Zurich. The latter also saw the foundation of a critical newspaper, the <span class="italic">Züricher Zeitung</span>, in 1780. Seven years later the <span class="italic">Journal de Genève</span> was founded. Exiles in Paris also remained vocally critical of the Swiss Ancien Régime .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though the resulting social dissent left the old order exposed, the system continued to hold together, and the endemic violence of the century rather died away. This temporary stability owed much to the intransigence of patrician leaders. The very complexity of the Ancien Régime’s structures was a further strength, providing it with multiple bases, including the support of France, the advantages of neutrality and the availability of military aid. The fact that the regime usually provided relatively good governance, prosperity and openings through military service and low taxes also helped, as did the fact that opposition was both fragmented and traditionalist, even if Chenaux’s rebels did try to invoke the American War of Independence in their rhetoric. However, the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 added a dangerous new dimension to dissent. Even though many of the resulting challenges remained quite traditionalist, calling for remedial and local reforms, the elites’ own past success in resisting change made it hard for them to make concessions. Successfully putting down popular outbursts had helped to strengthen their rule, so it is not surprising that they rejected revolutionary-era challenges in just the same way. Ultimately, internal pressures were unlikely to have led to regime change, but the oligarchs ’ failure to provide real remedies, notably where feudal dues and representation were involved, allowed intellectuals and extremists to facilitate the French aggression that brought down the Old Confederacy . The patrician reaction thus proved counter-productive even if challenges to it for long remained localized and traditionalist.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-1620"><span class="title">The Spreading Shadow of the French Revolution</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Given their geographical position, the Swiss cantons could not escape the effect of events in France. The French Revolution in fact <a id="page_124" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>cast a long shadow over Switzerland, thanks to its ideas, the disruptive effects of disturbances on Swiss borders, its impact on economically rising groups and, in the end, its military power. Initially the oligarchies were able to control the resulting intellectual ferment, but the increasingly extreme developments in France overshadowed the country, encouraging troubles that often meshed with industrial take-off and the appeal of the traditional liberation saga. The Diet , however, was too reactionary and divided to take the quasi-revolutionary steps that might have forestalled the overthrow of the Ancien Régime .</p>
<p class="calibre4">News of the Revolution led to the establishment of new reading societies , led by schoolmasters and rural clergy, which began to spring up in peripheral towns like Wädenswil, Stäfa and in the valley of Glatt in Zurich , encouraging peasant political awakening. Nonetheless, while the early Revolution fed into the disaffection latent in much of the Confederacy , no real groundswell of resistance to the existing order appeared. Very often, opposition was created as much by the intransigence of governments as by deep-seated political divisions. A growing number of intellectual dissidents were active, whether the exiles in Paris who created the Club Helvétique in 1790, or the Swiss pamphleteers outside the country, but they lacked the means to act. Prominent amongst the dissidents was Frédéric César de La Harpe , a lawyer from Vaud who had left his homeland because he could not stand the way it was governed by their Gracious Lords of Berne. He ended up serving as tutor to the grandsons of Catharine the Great of Russia . From St Petersburg he wrote articles in the <span class="italic">London Chronicle</span> demanding freedom for Vaud. The Bernese authorities immediately proscribed him, even though he was in Russia. Cantonal governments also sought to censor the press and guard the frontiers, but such intellectuals and exiles still created a good deal of pressure, especially in western Switzerland and in the secondary towns. The Vaudois peasantry , in contrast, had no rebellious traditions and often favoured the Bernese regime.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The first signs of internal protest came in Unter-Hallau which, in early 1790, refused to take an oath of allegiance to Schaffhausen and issued a memorandum demanding the restoration of its old rights as a free town. This was followed later in the year by unrest at Monthey in the Valais and the so-called ‘crochets’ conspiracy in the Chablais <a id="page_125" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>district in 1791. Berne sent in troops to restore order, but some districts began to buy back the feudal dues to which they were subject. By then, provocative banquets celebrating events in France had also begun in Vevey, Rolle and Ouchy. Demonstrators and banqueters were sharply warned by Berne, as troops and examining magistrates were sent in. La Harpe’s soldier cousin, Amedée de La Harpe , was condemned in absentia for subversion because of his active participation in a banquet. But none of this prevented new petitions for change and tax cuts. The magistrates’ response to these was uncoordinated and somewhat passive. Attempts by the Bernese after 1790 to impose censorship, halt movement and block talk of <a id="page_126" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>‘rights’ – which had spread following the dissemination of pamphlets from France – proved unavailing, since the new press followed events in Paris closely. Attempts at repression in Vaud in 1791 and in Zurich a few years later proved ineffective. Indeed, the proscription of the La Harpes merely strengthened the opposition to Bernese rule, leading to riots in Lausanne .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Subject areas, whether inside cantons or in the condominiums, were particularly vulnerable to unrest. In the Bishopric of Basle, where the Bishop , following the example of Basle city, had tried to head off trouble in 1790 by abolishing serfdom , the emerging political clubs transformed much of the principality into the Rauracienne Republic. When religious dissent and the Bishop’s call for Austrian support forced the French to invade in 1793, the bishopric became the French department of Mont Terrible. Abbot Beda of St Gallen also abolished feudalism in 1795, but two years later his successor reneged on this, and called in the Swiss to try to preserve his principality. But his peasants simply refused to pay the reimposed tithes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the Suisse Romande the oppressed French-speaking subjects in the Lower Valais demonstrated their unhappiness with their subjection after 1791. Elsewhere in the region there was trouble in Neuchâtel and Geneva. In 1792–3, the former saw clashes between Jacobin Clubs in Le Locle and La Chaux and government supporters. Geneva , being so close to France, was especially affected. As early as 1789, the 1782 settlement was repealed and the exiles were allowed to return. Food shortages also encouraged militancy, and very soon citizenship was made generally available. The new regime appealed to France for support, but Zurich and Berne blocked a French takeover in early 1792. However, by November of that year, Swiss troops were withdrawn in accord with the Swiss declaration of neutrality after the outbreak of the War of the First Coalition. Geneva soon followed Paris down the road to revolution, setting up an extremist regime that began to purge the old elite and established a new revolutionary constitution in 1794. The effects of the Thermidorian Reaction in France ended the local radicals’ dominance, and by 1798 the city was integrated into the one and indivisible French Republic. The annexation of Geneva was only one example of how <a id="page_127" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>French expansionism put the old Confederacy and its treaties under great pressure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The idea of change became especially appealing in the late 1790s, because competition from mechanically produced English textiles was beginning to deprive the textile industry of its markets. In German-speaking cantons, dissent over economic controls emerged in Aargau, but the most significant development came from the Stäfa district of Zurich in 1794, where trouble was sparked by a Memorandum from the local Reading Society demanding more rights. The authorities offered to act if it could be proved that the district’s rights had been violated; the locals then circulated a recently rediscovered charter issued after the fall of Hans Waldmann on the rights of the rural areas. The charter seemed to show that the area had enjoyed much more freedom in the late Middle Ages. When the government refused to confirm the charter, a more radical committee formed and began negotiating with the city. The Zurich government responded harshly, accusing Stäfa of rebellion and using troops from Zurich ’s farming regions and from other cantons (but not from areas of proto-industrialization) to occupy the town, although Lavater persuaded the magistrates not to execute a large number of the protesters. The Stäfa affair illustrates how local issues were increasingly becoming entwined with echoes of the revolution. The peasantry also became restive elsewhere, planting liberty trees in strongly patriotic Basle and St Gallen. Excitement was increased when Napoleon crossed Switzerland after his Italian campaigns, receiving a hero’s welcome from those favourable to change.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even after these developments, most cantonal governments resisted any changes to their structures that would reflect the way the balance of power was shifting in favour of outlying regions. This hesitation recapitulated their earlier failure to capitalize on the general revulsion over the massacre of the Swiss Guards in the Tuileries in Paris on 10 August 1792, which alarmed reformers as well as conservatives. Only minor adjustments occurred: Zug freed its outlying bailiwicks from subjection, and Berne offered to allow a few Vaudois into the charmed circle of political rights in order to sustain the elite’s numbers (though only their children and grandchildren would be entitled to hold offices). Basle also moved a little towards social reform. Unfortunately for the oligarchs, this was all <a id="page_128" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>much too little and too late. Nobody was willing to follow von Müller and Pestalozzi , who urged the sacrifice of privileges in order to survive. Resistance and counter-propaganda remained the regimes’ preferred strategy at the cantonal level.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the confederal level, the inherent weakness of the system became all too apparent after Schwyz in 1789 refused to agree to a renewal of the <span class="italic">Defensionale</span> , which coordinated joint efforts for defence of the borders. Likewise, the St Gallen politician Müller-Friedberg’s call for a new charter between all the cantons and allies had no effect. Such continuing preference for local over general interests made it almost impossible for the Confederacy to muster sufficient political and military force to resist French encroachments. It remained an assemblage of self-interested rural and urban communities. As a result, the Diet failed to agree on any emphatic measures until very late in the day, because disagreements and traditional arrogance continued to dominate, even though passive stability was no longer enough.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The French Revolution’s radical turn late in 1792 greatly influenced Swiss responses, since the Confederacy ’s push towards conservatism forced the country to break with France, which had been its most important ally for nearly three centuries. The link with France as a revolutionary republic now threatened to undermine, rather than support, the Ancien Régime. When European war broke out in 1792, the Diet declared its neutrality , in line with Zurich’s thinking, although the Bernese leadership wanted to join the Allies. In consequence, the Swiss troops who had moved into Geneva agreed to retire. However, Spain and the other Allies were allowed to recruit mercenaries freely, something made possible once the Diet withdrew its regiments from French service following the massacre of the Swiss Guards. The Diet also sanctioned the regiments in French royal service that rebelled because they were unpaid. These actions pushed the Confederacy firmly into the counter-revolutionary camp, as did the enthusiastic way Fribourg and other western cantons subsequently welcomed hundreds of French nobles and others who were forced to emigrate after the abolition of the monarchy and under the Terror. The link with France had become a weakness, rather than a means of strengthening the Ancien Régime. The intervention of Britain through William Wickham, its envoy in <a id="page_129" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Switzerland, provided little real balance and merely annoyed the French. Basle especially found itself in trouble, because its bankers had lent generously to the now hated monarchy. Nonetheless, once France signed the Peace of Basle with Prussia in 1795 and negotiations at Rastatt with Austria had started, a majority of cantonal regimes assumed that the crisis had passed. They were unaware that, with the Thermidorian Reaction and the rise of the Directory, France was looking beyond its frontiers. Especially after Napoleon’s victories in Italy and the coup of 18 Fructidor in 1797, the French regime began to covet Swiss land, resources and routes, partly because these provided a vital link to Italy, and partly because the new regime was aggressively imperialist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The idea of intervention in Switzerland arose in discussions between the Director Reubell, an Alsatian, and Swiss radicals led by La Harpe and Peter Ochs of Basle. La Harpe had been forced to leave Russia in 1795, and after a stay in the Genevan village of Genthod had moved to Paris. His hostility to Berne had been intensified by his unsuccessful attempt to recover the goods and reputation of his cousin Amedée, who had been killed in action in French service. In 1796–7 he produced a forceful essay on the Vaudois constitution, which had considerable impact in his homeland. Ochs, a Basle lawyer and administrator, had long been a supporter of the Enlightenment , having been influenced by Iselin . Town clerk of Basle from 1790, he became head of the guilds in 1796. The following year he was invited back to Paris by Napoleon , who had apparently decided to set up a unitary and pro-French state in Switzerland, believing that unification was the only way to block the oligarchs and allow the French to control the country. The French were aware that they could easily exploit Swiss divisions. Indeed, Ochs was persuaded to help organize a pacific revolution in Switzerland. By then Mulhouse , a long-term ally of the Confederacy, was slipping towards integration with France while the Valtellina , having been refused recognition as a fourth league of the Grisons , was lost to France ’s Cisalpine satellite.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite the worsening situation, little was done to modernize cantonal militias in response to the Revolution. Even the Bernese forces were in great need of reform, partly because the canton was, for once, in financial difficulties. In fact, despite the use of spies, <a id="page_130" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>censorship , repression and counter-propaganda, the situation in Switzerland became very fragile. The oligarchs’ traditions and the way circumstances had pushed them into the arms of the counter-Revolution made them obvious targets for French hostility. Yet even as La Harpe was petitioning the French on 9 December 1797 to invade and free Vaud, and Ochs in Paris was talking constitutions with the Directory, all the Diet did was launch an effort to renew the old alliances, which had not been done since the sixteenth century. Even this symbolic act was almost too much for the confederal assembly and took a month to manage, such was the distrust amongst the cantons. The Confederacy was too stagnant to be able to respond to the influence of the Revolution before this took on a military form.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By then, in fact, the French army was poised on the frontiers, having warned Berne and Fribourg on 28 December 1797 that Vaud was under its protection. On 25 January 1798 the Diet broke up, having made no military preparations despite the French menace. When the French occupied Vaud a few days later, however, many western patrician regimes finally bowed to circumstances and yielded up many of their prerogatives. A month later the French army moved eastward, forcing the Bernese government to appeal for military aid from the other cantons, but very little support materialized. In early March, the Bernese regime also yielded after allowing their troops – which were continuing the fight – to be needlessly defeated at Grauholz . Once the city was occupied, many leading Bernese patricians went into exile, while most of western and central Switzerland fell under French control. Only in the mountains of central Switzerland did the Ancien Régime continue, intermittently, to resist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The old order thus effectively abdicated in 1798, both nationally and at the cantonal level. The very success of the oligarchs in cementing their position up to that point, moreover, meant that no convincing new political forces had been able to develop which might have supported them. The late eighteenth-century push to strengthen the Ancien Régime had apparently succeeded but, in fact, the cantonal oligarchies were too rigid and too divided to adapt to new challenges or develop the national military or political organizations that might have saved them. Tellingly, the Catholic cantons had continued to refuse to be bound by the <span class="italic">Defensionale</span> . The Confederacy ’s passive <a id="page_131" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>strength, even with a changed religious balance, was no match for French military dynamism as this emerged from the shadow of the Revolution . Moreover, the deference that had helped sustain oligarchical rule was swept away cataclysmically in the 1790s, as the patricians paid the price for not using their earlier successes to create a more balanced regime. In the end, Swiss stability proved illusory. Hence the complete collapse of the old order in Switzerland after 1797 opened the way for a half-century of troubled attempts to create a new political order.</p>
