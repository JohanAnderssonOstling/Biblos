<p class="noindent">The French invasion of 1798 unleashed both a political revolution in Switzerland and a half-century of contention over the validity and nature of the new polity that then emerged. This contention, moreover, took place much more within a single Swiss political arena than had been the case before, so that increasingly it becomes possible to look at Switzerland in terms of a single narrative. This began in 1798 when the old order was overthrown by a combination of its own weaknesses, the work of a nationally minded minority and French military muscle. Together, the possibility of armed intervention and the clear impotence and bad faith of the Ancien Régime liberated the enthusiasm of patriot forces. Because of French military backing, the country had to accept the replacement of the old order by a new centralized Helvetic Republic , which however found itself plagued by contention over its nature, its powers and even its very existence. Consequently, although it superficially united the country and ended the old Confederacy, the Helvetic regime never succeeded in creating a stable state. Much conflict and argument over the precise nature of the new polity was to follow before this was finally achieved in 1848.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Indeed, the Helvetic Republic very soon descended into civil war , which allowed Napoleon to impose a compromise solution that earned the Swiss a few years of relative stability and prosperity. But with his fall came the resurgence of older forces. In 1815 the Great Powers managed to temper the cantons’ reactionary aspirations to some extent when they endowed the country with a conservative Confederal Charter . However, the post-war regime was then <a id="page_133" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>challenged by the Holy Alliance and by disgruntled liberal supporters of the post-1798 reforms. Aided by the increasing pace of industrialization the liberals broke through in 1830 and ‘regenerated’ the constitutions of most cantons , ending all hopes of a return to an Ancien Régime dominated by capital cities and their elites. Some wished to end change there, others to take it further, although the latter’s aspirations for a national and social solution conflicted with both conservative and Catholic leanings. Diverging visions eventually led to a civil war, won by radical forces and leading to Switzerland becoming, for the first time, a real federal state. In all this, Switzerland was very much part of Europe’s emerging national movement.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-1738"><span class="title">The Helvetic Period:</span><span class="subtitle">Revolution, Resistance and Constitutional Experiments</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The initial Swiss revolution of 1798 began among self-proclaimed ‘patriots’ in Basle and Vaud. Under often violent pressure from the previously oppressed countryside, Basle gave its countryside equality with the city, drafted a new constitution and, in early February 1798, set up a National Assembly , the first modern representative parliament in Switzerland. In Vaud , the patriots seized the chateau of Chillon while local leaders in Lausanne set up new committees to try to steer the unrest in the town in more moderate directions. But enthusiasm triumphed and, on 23–4 January, a whole forest of liberty trees – often crowned by a Phrygian bonnet or a Green ‘Tell’ cap – was erected and a Lemanic Republic was proclaimed. These developments were mainly the work of La Harpe and other patriots who wanted to succeed where heroes like Davel , Henzi and Péquinat had failed, but change would not have been possible without French support. In fact, the French Resident in Geneva publicly incited the Vaudois to rise and, when they did, their revolutions were underwritten by the French army. Its commander, General Guillaume Brune , used an incident at Thierrens , when Vaudois gendarmes fired on French soldiers escorting a French envoy, killing one of them, as an excuse to invade and occupy Vaud. As a result, local enthusiasm was overtaken by French power politics, which first determined the shape of the new order and then thrust Switzerland into a damaging new war. This intervention helped <a id="page_134" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>to undermine the new Swiss order, which deteriorated to such a point that Napoleon had to set it aside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Initially, however, events in Basle and Vaud liberated revolutionary enthusiasm elsewhere. Thousands of liberty trees went up across Switzerland, and many mass meetings demanded reform, notably at Weinfelden in Thurgau , as subjects of the old cantons rebelled against their overlords in the name of economic freedom and a fair share in political decision-making. Several little local republics briefly emerged. A number of patrician regimes, notably Zurich , rapidly took the double hint and began to allow former subjects to share power. Fribourg, too, drafted a new constitution and admitted non-citizens to its councils. Even though change was also underway in <a id="page_135" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Berne and Solothurn , Brune nevertheless marched eastward in late February, calling on the Swiss to unite into one state as he did so. Fribourg and Solothurn immediately capitulated, and when the Bernese authorities received little aid from their allies, they too yielded in early March. Once Berne was occupied, the city treasury was stripped, its arsenal taken over and its bears shipped to Paris, while most of western and central Switzerland fell under direct French control.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The patriots had started by reforming their own localities, but French pressure and the legacy of the Helvetian thinking earlier in the century meant that there was bound to be change at the national level. In fact, when Napoleon declined to produce a confederal rulebook himself, Ochs produced a draft constitution which he discussed with the new Basle Assembly . A more conservative rewrite by the Directory in Paris quickly overtook his efforts, and was immediately printed and, in early February, circulated in western Switzerland. Although a number of cantons approved the revised Basle draft, the French refused to be shifted from their text, and simply decreed that acceptance of the Basle project constituted support for their own version. Thus, at Aarau on 12 April 1798, the French-drafted text was formally proclaimed and the new unitary Helvetic Republic inaugurated. This was the first time that the country had been treated as a single polity, let alone endowed with a single constitutional document. The political nation was also expanded by giving full cantonal status to most of the former subject territories. Aargau , Thurgau and Vaud became cantons more or less as they are today, while the Italian territories and what was to become St Gallen were also included, though not yet in their modern forms.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The French army swiftly completed its occupation of the country. It moved on Lucerne and Zurich in late April and, despite being checked at Rothenturm, eventually defeated forces from Schwyz led by a former mercenary officer, Alois Reding . Such continued resistance revealed that, although the Ancien Régime was overthrown in 1798, its supporters did not go away. Rather, they continued to oppose the French-dominated regimes that followed, sometimes in arms, at other times politically. They were thus intimately involved in the long series of short-lived constitutional experiments that followed.</p>
<a id="page_136" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">In any case, by late May 1798, the country was largely subdued and could be dragooned into applying the Helvetic structures. On paper the Helvetic Republic was a strongly unitary state with a powerful five-man Directorate as the executive. A Senate of four members per canton, an indirectly elected Grand Council, a High Court and a volunteer army completed the government. The cantons were downgraded to mere administrative units, subject to a Prefect and no longer able to claim sovereignty or to create barriers against the centre. Their structure was frequently revised, moreover, with the fractious Urschweiz cantons <a id="page_137" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>sometimes unwillingly merged into a new Waldstätten canton, and the Bernese Oberland given autonomous status so as to weaken the influence of Berne . Some of the new cantons were also divided and renamed so as to reduce their influence.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1779"><img src="../images/00032.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">Figure 5.1 </span>The organization of the Helvetic Republic</div>
<p class="calibre4">The new constitution was intended as much as a means of ensuring French control and an extension of its <span class="italic">la grande nation</span> policy as a way of creating a Swiss democracy. When some of the original Helvetic Directors dared to challenge Paris, they were ousted and replaced by La Harpe and Ochs. In reality, the Helvetic Republic was anything but one and indivisible, and was resisted by an amalgam of supporters of the Ancien Régime , a populace hostile to new impositions and Catholics antagonized by the anti-religious nature of the revolution. It proved hard for the newly installed Directory to implement the new unitarian order, both because it lacked the manpower and the resources to do this and because it was also continually challenged by the resentful cantons. Both resistance to new central taxes and the Directory’s association with secularizing France – along with the depredations of French soldiery – spurred resistance. The government was also forced to sign an offensive and defensive alliance with France, which signalled the end of neutrality . In mid-August 1798, when the people of Nidwald en were asked to take an oath of allegiance to the new constitution – locally derided as ‘an infernal brochure’ because of its lack of any invocation of the Almighty – they revolted. They arrested patriots and officials and mobilized their forces, only to be crushed with heavy losses. Pestalozzi set up his famous orphanage in Stans to care for and educate the many orphans left by the conflict.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Partly because the rebels had hoped for Austrian military aid, the French launched the War of the Second Coalition in February 1799. The war hit the country extremely hard, and not merely because the French tried to call up the 18,000 Swiss soldiers promised them by the new treaty. Switzerland was also subject to innumerable requisitions, while its lands were laid waste by battle and its agriculture was crippled by loss of livestock and an inability to plant. Hunger became rife in the winter of 1799–1800. The war started well for France, with Masséna occupying the Grisons and turning it into a new, full canton. When the French began losing ground in Italy , Masséna fell back north-westwards, only to be defeated at the First <a id="page_138" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Battle of Zurich on 4 June. Although he was able to retreat further to a defensive position on the left bank of the Limmat , most of eastern and southern Switzerland fell under the control of the Austrians, supported by English finance and political activity. Counter-revolution raised its head in Zug , while the Bernese diplomat and administrator Karl Ludwig von Haller , the son of Albrecht von Haller , broke with reform and began to assail the new order through his newspaper, <span class="italic">The Annals of Helvetia</span>, helping to develop an ideological challenge to revolutionary patriotism .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Things became even more threatening for the French when Russian troops under Korsakov pushed up from Italy to relieve the hard-pressed Austrians. However, the Russians were out-generaled and heavily defeated by Masséna at the Second Battle of Zurich on 25–6 September 1799. Another Russian force under Suvorov tried to relieve Korsakov, but was unable to force its way through the Gotthard , which forced it to make a harrowing retreat through the Alps. By the end of 1799 the devastated country was again free of Allied troops.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The government had been severely weakened during the war, and had to retreat from Lucerne to Berne. Yet La Harpe still chose to force Ochs out on the grounds that he was too pro-French. The regime also sought to abolish tithes and feudal dues, but never had the resources to provide the needed compensation. Ultimately, La Harpe tried to imitate Napoleon and stage his own coup to strengthen the regime. But the First Consul found him too idealistic and too independent for his more conservative taste, and lent his weight to moderate republicans in the Councils, led by Paul Usteri , a distinguished scientist and journalist from Zurich, who purged La Harpe on 8 January 1800, sending him into long-term exile. These events broke the existing rules, thus adding to instability, especially as the new leadership itself lasted only to August 1800, when it was in turn purged by other moderates and replaced by a nominated legislative council, pending a new constitution . Abortive attempts to buy out feudal dues, despite their failure, triggered a crop of separatist risings in the east of the country amongst opponents of the new order, while the endless constitutional tinkering which followed 1798 provoked opposition from Schwyz and other traditionalist areas.</p>
<a id="page_139" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Meanwhile, Napoleon himself had grown tired of the wrangling over the Swiss constitution, and decided to endorse a new draft at Malmaison on 29 May 1801. His proposal restored recognition of the cantons as self-determining, while still keeping a single national polity. Swiss politicians largely ignored Napoleon’s efforts, and in the Vaud half the electorate petitioned for a return to Bernese rule. A further coup then brought to power federalists who believed in cantonal independence, if they did not hope for restoration of the Ancien Régime as a whole. Their leader was Reding , who flirted with Austria and opposed detaching Valais from the Confederacy, thereby arousing Napoleon’s ire. After a failed constitutional referendum , Reding’s government was ousted on 17 April 1802 by the Unitarians , supporters of the Helvetic Republic , under the pro-French Johann Rudolf Dolder of Aargau. The following month a new constitution , based on Malmaison and including a strong executive, was submitted to a referendum. Although it garnered only 72,900 votes in its favour, 20,000 less than those objecting, it was declared passed on the grounds that the 167,000 abstentions were effectively votes for the new order. But the reality was that it was rejected at the local level, so strong was the continuing resistance to change.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This was merely one of the Unitarian government’s problems. Additionally, it was going bankrupt and was facing massive social dissidence. In Vaud the ‘Bourla-Papey’ movement was burning tithe records in protest against the high cost of redeeming feudal dues, forcing the authorities to abolish them without any compensation at all. Generally, the country seemed to be slipping into multipolar civil war, which gave a disillusioned Napoleon the chance to bring the Swiss to their senses. He withdrew French troops and left the regime to its fate. Federalist revolts broke out, focused on Lucerne where Reding tried to summon the old Diet . Attempts by the Unitarian government to repress the rising failed abysmally, but stimulated aggrieved peasants in the north-east to take to the field, armed with stakes and agricultural implements – hence the nickname of <span class="italic">Stecklikrieg</span> . In the end, the Unitarian army was chased back into Vaud and defeated at Faoug on 3 October 1802.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Such chaos proved Napoleon’s contention that the Swiss could not govern themselves. The restored Diet had never met, allowing <a id="page_140" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Napoleon to impose a ceasefire, send French troops back into Switzerland to prevent the federalists wreaking vengeance on the Unitarians, and coerce most of the Swiss elite to attend a Consulta in St Cloud to draft a lasting settlement. Most of the Swiss delegates realized that the alternative was another crushing military offensive. Composed largely of federalists , the Consulta proceeded through discussions with three French aides who were well acquainted with Switzerland. On the basis of these talks, and Napoleon’s own belief that the country could be governed only with the cantons and not against them (as the Helvetic Republic had tried to do), a draft was produced, submitted to Napoleon and then revised before being promulgated on 19 February 1803.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Three weeks later the Helvetic Republic dissolved, having had its day. It had given Switzerland unity, symbols, institutions and national citizenship as well as expanding the number of cantons, a term it used formally for the first time. But it was unable to create a lasting balance between nation and cantons, nor had it ever acquired legitimacy or stable mass support. Because it was tied so closely to France, it had failed to implant either a sense of national identity or even a willingness to tolerate its existence. As a failed state, even its liberating economic stance was contested.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-1826"><span class="title">Mediation :</span><span class="subtitle">Stability on Sufferance</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">If the next ten years were to be rather happier ones for the Swiss, their calm and stability rested on shallow foundations, as events after the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 were to show. This was partly because the regime’s stability depended on French military success, and partly because support for a return to the Ancien Régime had not been eliminated, but merely obscured, by the Mediation settlement. This made concessions to the forces of resistance but, because it maintained the new-style Switzerland, it left conservatives unhappy. Hence on the fall of Napoleon the Allies had to step in to restrain them and ensure that moderation continued.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1832"><img src="../images/00033.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">5.1 </span>Liberty tree in Basle, 1798. The city, a stronghold of patriotic reformism, copied the French revolutionary habit of erecting these symbols of liberty, a practice replacing the traditional use of maypoles. Liberty trees were often crowned with a Tell cap and used for important political acts. Opponents saw them as suggesting foreign domination. Hence they vanished with the fall of the Helvetic Republic, only to make a partial return in 1830–1.</div>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-1833"><img src="../images/00034.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">5.2 </span>Louis Auguste Philippe d’Affry. A former soldier in French service and a leading figure in Swiss politics, d’Affry was well known to Napoleon, so the latter chose him in 1803 as the Mediation’s first Landammann, reflecting also the fact that the Diet met in his home town of Fribourg. His ability led to his reappointment in 1809. The way he is pictured here with the new constitution suggests a desire to encourage the association of the new regime with the old elite, thus reassuring conservatives about a settlement that they accepted only on sufferance.</div>
<p class="calibre4">The Mediation Act, on which the 1803–14 regime was based, consisted of a Preamble stressing the country’s federalist character, nineteen cantonal constitutions – including Grisons , St Gallen and Ticino , which were established within their modern borders – and a <a id="page_141" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_142" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>confederal charter. Despite the new equality among the cantons, their individual constitutions varied greatly. The Catholic cantons maintained a narrow franchise and restricted rights, while the new creations were more democratic. Nonetheless, in all cases it was the cantons that provided sovereignty . The fact that the confederal constitution came at the end was symptomatic of this. The new regime was chaired by a rotating directing canton, known as the Vorort , whose head was the Landammann of the new executive, a body with rather limited powers. In a partial return to the Ancien Régime model of Switzerland as a congeries of cantons, the Mediation allowed landowners, patricians and aristocrats back into power. All this was in line with Napoleon’s claim that the new settlement meant the end of the revolution for Switzerland. More significantly, Switzerland remained a protectorate of France , which controlled the Swiss through the new military alliance of 27 September 1803. This allowed France to raise 16,000 troops from Switzerland, and to summon the Diet on its own authority, despite Napoleon’s affirmation that there should be ‘no chains on the children of Tell’ . Napoleon’s rhetoric reflected the way in which the Tell myth had been adopted by the French Revolution and, after the publication of Schiller’s play in 1804, by much of Europe. Ironically, Schiller appears not to have believed in the historicity of Tell and saw him as a symbol of the human condition, but his play was to have great resonance inside Switzerland. For example, it forced Müller to revise his history to highlight the Tell story.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although the new regime started life on 4 July 1803 amidst a new wave of rural revolts, as Zurich peasant columns marched on their capital demanding the restoration of the political rights they had enjoyed since 1798, the Mediation era proved to be a better time for Switzerland. Thanks to peace and to the protection offered by Napoleon’s Continental System after 1806, the economy grew. The system cut off competitive English imports of textiles , and encouraged the Swiss to mechanize their own production. Encouraged by the government, a Vaudois entrepreneur called Pellis had set up the first mechanized cotton spinning works in St Gallen in 1801. The experiment rapidly caught on in Appenzell and Zurich, so that by 1814 there were 1,700 mechanized mills in Switzerland with more opening every year, taking Swiss power supplies beyond men and <a id="page_143" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>horses for the first time. Metallurgy and chocolate also began to mechanize. As well as developing the Swiss industrial revolution, the period also saw progress in agriculture as tithes were bought out. The Mediation governments also encouraged public works, such as the construction of a new Simplon road and the taming of the river Linth in Glarus. Despite crises in 1803–6 and 1811–12, social problems eased and population growth resumed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The period also did more to develop national feeling at a popular level than had the Helvetic interlude, mainly through the creation of new national associations such as the reformed Helvetic Society in 1807, the Swiss Public Utility Society in 1810 and the Swiss Society for Historical Research in 1813. Renewed historical interest was reflected in the success of Johannes von Müller’s history of medieval Switzerland, the fourth and fifth volumes of which were published in 1805 and 1808. More popular activities thrived, such as the successful Unspunnen folk games in Interlaken in 1805 and 1808, featuring wrestling, flag-throwing and yodelling. Johan-Rudolf Wyss , from the family of the author of <span class="italic">The Swiss Family Robinson</span>, wrote ‘When you call, my Fatherland’ (<span class="italic">Rufst du Mein Vaterland</span>), which (set to the tune of ‘God Save the King’) was to serve as a national anthem for many years. National feeling was clearly developing across society and not just amongst the elite.</p>
<p class="calibre4">French pressure ensured a darker side to the period, as well. The country had to accept conscription, which was not always popular. Some 30,500 Swiss served in the Grand Army, some of them even as marines on board ship at Trafalgar, and some in the front line at Borodino during the Russian campaign; few returned. Neutrality was ignored and Swiss independence remained at risk, since Napoleon considered annexing the country. This did not happen, but Neuchâtel was turned into a principality for Berthier, his chief-of-staff, Valais became a French départment to guard the Simplon Pass and Ticino was occupied in 1810. Such losses helped ensure that the regime never won broad support, even amongst the federalists whom Napoleon had returned to power. In the end, the Mediation depended on French military power: when Napoleon suffered a major defeat at Leipzig on 16–19 October 1813, it began to subside, both nationally and at the cantonal level, where previously quiescent political aspirations began to reassert themselves. Nationally, the <a id="page_144" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Diet reasserted its sovereignty dramatically by sending a delegation to Napoleon to inform him that Switzerland would henceforward be neutral , something he now welcomed as it offered a guarantee of his south-east flank. The Diet also raised 10,000 men to guard the Rhine . However, its attempt to reassert neutrality was resisted at home by reactionaries, who looked to Allied aid, and was ignored by Austrian General Bubna and his 130,00-strong army, which marched across Switzerland from Aargau to Geneva , which he liberated in December. Ironically, Bubna used his influence to prevent Berne from repossessing Aargau and Vaud , and Geneva from going back to the 1770s. He, more than the old oligarchs, was aware that such moves were a recipe for renewed civil war.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On 29 December 1813 the Diet declared the Mediation regime dead and set about trying to convene a new Diet. The conservative cantons , which wanted to reconvene the Ancien Régime Diet in Lucerne , at first opposed this move. Their resistance reflected the way the old patrician regimes had re-emerged from the shadows, seized power and reasserted their old privileges, beginning in Berne in December and continuing in Lucerne – where there was an armed coup in mid-February 1814 –Solothurn, Fribourg , Lucerne, Schaffhausen  and Valais . These developments showed that, despite the gains it had brought to Switzerland, the Mediation had been accepted only on sufferance. The hearts of many Swiss remained with the old order. However, this revived counter-revolution provoked alarmed peasants in Thurgau to march on Frauenfeld to preserve their recently won rights. The country was, in fact, on the verge of civil war , and it was only with great difficulty, and owing to foreign pressure, that the conservatives were persuaded to go to Zurich in April and take part in what became known as the Long Diet .</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Great Powers, notably the Russian envoy Capo d’Istria , made the Diet work on a new constitution , for which traditionalists saw no need. The Allies, however, insisted on the preservation of the new cantons the French had created out of the former subject territories and allies and added Geneva, Neuchâtel and Valais to their number. A draft was approved in February, but was then pruned by the Allies meeting in the Congress of Vienna . In fact it took considerable Allied pressure to force a new compromise regime on the Swiss, many of whom sought to return to the Ancien Régime.</p>
<a id="page_145" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">The Swiss delegates to the Allies were also involved in difficult negotiations over their borders. The military wanted considerable extensions so as to create defensible frontiers, but was largely unsuccessful, being blocked by the French . Equally, the Valtellina was not restored to the Grisons . Berne did receive compensation for its ‘colonial’ losses by the acquisition of the former Bishopric of Basle’s lands in the Jura . The final deal, which left the country slightly larger and stronger than before, was approved in March 1815. Meanwhile, the new Charter had been approved by the Allies on 7 September 1814, after the Diet formally voted to accept Geneva , Neuchâtel and Valais as cantons, showing that the Swiss were willing to accept the impact of the revolution and new national desires .</p>
<p class="calibre4">None of this was upset by the Hundred Days, although Napoleon’s return prompted the Diet to show even more determination, rashly declaring war and sending 20,000 men under General von Bachmann into Franche Comté to hold the frontier and support the Swiss claim to the Jura. Unfortunately, this proved to be one of the most inglorious episodes in Swiss military history, since many of the ill-supplied soldiers mutinied, refusing to serve outside Switzerland. In any case, Austrian forces preparing to invade France took no notice and crossed the country anyway. Nonetheless, in mid-August 1815, the new constitution was promulgated by the departing Long Diet. Previously, on 9 June, Pictet de Rochemont, a senior Genevan representative, had persuaded the Allies to recognize that Swiss neutrality was in the general interest of Europe. This claim was formally confirmed by an Allied Declaration of 20 November 1815.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The new Charter was essentially a treaty amongst sovereign cantonal states. The cantons mutually guaranteed their own security and constitutions – often quite backward-looking – and sent representatives to the Diet under strict mandates. The Charter did not provide for a Landammann , a national judiciary or separation of powers. Nonetheless, it represented a step beyond the Mediation and towards a Swiss Confederation , the term being formally used for the first time. It contained a commitment to a common fatherland and gave the Confederation new powers. Significantly, the Diet could make binding decisions by a two-thirds majority. Cantons were banned from <a id="page_146" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>creating leagues amongst themselves, and the Diet gained responsibility for upholding confederal decisions, a new power, as well as for trade , diplomacy and defence. For the first time, a national army was established, even if it was made up of cantonal contingents.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-1935"><span class="title">Restoration, Liberalism and ‘Regeneration’, 1815–1831</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Unfortunately the settlement did not end contention about who should control the new order. This was one of the dominating themes of the next fifteen years or so, because the events of the revolutionary era had had lasting effects on progressive public opinion, producing a new patriotic and anti-conservative movement. Such supporters of change developed a new liberal creed and ultimately broke through the forces of resistance in 1829–31, bringing to an end the hopes of those who wanted to restore the Ancien Régime . Such a counter-revolutionary restoration had seemed quite possible in 1814–15, since, profiting from the chaos of the times, the patricians had been able to rebuild much of their old control. Indeed, Fribourg simply reappointed the seventy-five members of the Grand Council still surviving from 1789. The old elite also regained control of mercenary contracts. Their stance was underwritten by the new ideology advocated by Haller in his 1816 <span class="italic">Restauration der Staatswissenschaften</span>, which claimed that legitimacy lay only in historic privilege and communal liberties. Despite the share they had had in devising the new order, the Great Powers did not refrain from intervening in Swiss politics, believing that neutrality allowed this. Switzerland was forced first to express an ambiguous adhesion to the Holy Alliance in 1817, and then, six years later, to pass a ‘Conclusum’ on the Press and Refugees. These measures responded to the Allies’ dislike of Swiss tolerance of a free press and political exiles, and led to increased censorship and some expulsions. In practice, however, many cantons usually chose to evade extradition requests.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The new conditions challenged those who had benefited from the Helvetic and Mediation regimes : intellectuals, rural and small-town middle classes and peasants. Reversion to the old forms of privilege for corporate entities, territories and enterprises cost them dearly, and also clashed with their own emerging ideology. Stressing rights, <a id="page_147" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>representative government and education , the new liberalism (as it came to be known) found focus in the work of the Vaudois Benjamin Constant , then a member of the French Chamber of Deputies. In his 1816 book, <span class="italic">The Liberty of the Ancients Compared with that of the Moderns</span>, he argued that Europe should follow English precedents. Although liberalism at first failed to influence the restored regimes, it ensured that the country remained riven by political and intellectual contention well into the nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Conflict was often underwritten by the economic problems of the times. After a brief post-war boom, a major slump followed in 1816–18. This came about partly because of the return of English textile competition, which hit hand workers very badly. But the country also suffered what was to be its last harvest crisis, producing starvation and significant emigration, notably to the unsuccessful colony of Novo Friburgo in Brazil. Printers in Aarau responded by setting up their own sickness and invalidity scheme. While some entrepreneurs, such as the founders of the first chemical plant in Utikon, thrived, governments seemed helpless. Conditions were exacerbated because the Restoration regimes had brought back guilds , internal customs and tolls. Some 400 toll stations forced goods to be unloaded from packhorses, checked and reloaded, which was an immense disincentive to trade . Cantons also refused to grant rights of free settlement to Swiss from other cantons. Those who suffered from this protested, as in a tax strike in Schaffhausen in 1820.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The European revolutions of 1821 further encouraged the emergence of a new crop of voluntary bodies, which eventually provided the foundations for a liberal and national movement. These included student associations, like the Zofingen association of 1819, the historically focused Sempacher Verein of 1821, and the Sharpshooters of 1824. The revived Helvetic Society also played an increasingly political role. Historical thinking played a continuing part in political movements, as demonstrated by the Lion of Lucerne monument celebrating the massacre of the Swiss Guards in the Tuileries in 1792. National feeling was also strengthened by the new Confederation’s main achievement, the development of the army with new regulations and, from 1818, a training school in Thun, financed by a levy on customs revenues. In the 1820s the army, under Guilliaume-Henri Dufour – a soldier and engineer who had served in the armies of Napoleon before helping to set up <a id="page_148" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>the War College – began producing its pioneering maps of Switzerland, seen as one of the few Swiss projects prior to 1848.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Liberalism was also both cause and effect of politically committed newspapers such as the <span class="italic">Aarauer Zeitung</span> and the revived <span class="italic">Neue Zürcher Zeitung</span> in 1821, and the <span class="italic">Appenzeller Zeitung</span> seven years later. In the West, Philhellenism, encouraged by the Greek uprising against the Turks, had an important impact on Swiss national feeling as well. The establishment’s hold on Swiss politics was also weakened by the religious <span class="italic">Reveil</span> or ‘Awakening’ that began to challenge the hold of established Protestant Churches, notably in Geneva and Vaud, through renewed stress on the Bible, personal piety and systematic observance. At the same time the Catholic Church also felt the impact of Illuminism and mysticism, as well as of the recall of the Jesuits and the reorganization both of its bishoprics and its links with the state.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Opposition to the post-war regime increased as the economy grew strongly in the late 1820s. The population rose, reaching 2.1 million by 1830. An increasing number of peasants became landowners growing cereals, as the midlands became the driving force in Swiss agriculture . Even so, the country could not feed itself, and needed to export manufactures to Eastern Europe to generate the monies needed to buy food. This ensured that Switzerland remained committed to free trade, though in 1822 it was only the mountain cantons that prevented retaliation against French protectionism. As mechanization progressed, Switzerland came to account for 23 per cent of all mechanized cotton textile production , and exported textile products globally. For many of those involved in this growth, the restrictions and humiliations of the Restoration regime became increasingly hard to bear. Indeed opposition to mechanized weaving was to lead to the destruction of a much-resented pioneering factory in Uster in 1832, something encouraged by the growing movement for political change at the time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Growing dissatisfaction became visible in an intensification of liberal activism, seen in the planting of liberty trees in the Bernese Jura and Lower Valais . Constitutional changes in Schaffhausen and Lucerne strengthened parliaments and gave more weight to the rural population, while Geneva also made timid alterations in procedure after a series of petitions. Even where similar liberal petitions in Vaud <a id="page_149" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>and Valais were rejected, pressure was clearly becoming harder to resist. In 1828 Glarus abolished censorship , reflecting the rise of a market for a liberal press. The Diet followed suit in 1829 by formally revoking the Conclusum . That same year, more evidence of growing liberal ferment came with unrest in Aargau over the excessive length of some official tenures, and in Basle and Zurich , where rural craftsmen protested against economic restraints. There were also violent disturbances in the Inner Rhoden of Appenzell that forced the Diet to intervene, leading to a constitutional reform that limited the power of the old families, which had been manoeuvring to go back to the Ancien Régime . In Vaud , further large-scale petitioning for reform panicked the government into a pre-emptive constitutional reform, only to find that its limited terms actually fuelled popular annoyance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By then, events in the Ticino had led to the first real constitutional breakthrough. In May 1829, personal rivalries in the elite led former Landammann Maggi to propose reforms to enfranchise the outlying areas. Although rejected out of hand by local dictator Gian Battista Quadri, the idea gathered great support, especially when publicized by a young teacher and intellectual, Stefano Franscini , in his January 1830 pamphlet <span class="italic">Della Riforma della Costituzione Ticinese</span>. This generated sufficient pressure to force the elite to disown Quadri and pass a reform package in late June, a decision conformed by referendum on 4 July, well ahead of the July Days in Paris, and still known as ‘the first love of the Ticinese people’ .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thus, thunder can be said to have been in the air that July, and the news from Paris – from which Swiss mercenaries were rapidly withdrawn – accelerated an ongoing process across the country of petitioning and protest. Although the Vorort on 22 September counselled calm and resistance to change, it was already too late. By then, the delaying tactics used against calls for reform in Aargau had already triggered an electoral strike and the threat of a popular march on Aarau . In October, both Thurgau and Zurich saw massive pressure for change, encouraged by pamphleteers such as Pastor Thomas Bornhauser and German exile Ludwig Snell, who attracted thousands to popular meetings. These forced the calling of constituent assemblies, which led to new constitutions . In Aargau, Fribourg, Lucerne and Vaud, popular marches on the cantonal <a id="page_150" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>capital brought similar changes. Faced with popular mobilization, the Diet changed its mind and, on 27 December, recognized the sovereign right of the cantons to change their constitutions; cantonal governments then gave way in Basle, Berne, Lucerne, Schaffhausen, Solothurn and St Gallen. Even cantons like Geneva and Neuchâtel, which were not directly affected by the movement, thought it wise to make adjustments. Only the cantons of Urschweiz , along with Grisons and Valais , held out against the trend, which saw a majority of cantons undergoing a set of liberalizing constitutional changes which, following Snell, historians now call the Regeneration.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Regeneration was a clear victory for peasants and the middle classes of smaller towns, who had long suffered discrimination at the hands of cantonal capitals. It brought them new social, political and individual rights. To begin with, it did away with feudal privileges and the economic restraints reintroduced in 1815. Interestingly, city walls also started to be pulled down around this time, as capitals opened up to their surrounding countryside. Regeneration also reformed institutions, especially by giving more power to legislatures and making them more representative. In Zurich , for example, the countryside got two-thirds of the seats in the reformed body. The reforms also increased the separation of powers, limited office-holding terms and created collegial governments. Not only were most of the constitutions approved by popular vote, something which became <span class="italic">de rigueur</span>, but they also introduced new direct-democratic rights, such as the popular veto or the right to challenge new legislation, established in St Gallen and Basle Country. Even where there were no new constitutions, many cantons carried out partial revisions. Lastly the Regeneration ended censorship and greatly boosted both the press and education . These changes wrote finis to any remaining hopes of returning to the Ancien Régime , thereby creating a new kind of politics.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-2025"><span class="title">The Failures of Liberalism and Nationalism</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Like the 1815 settlement before it, the victory of liberalism around 1830 did not end contention . Indeed, it often intensified it, partly because even though cantonal constitutions had been modernized, it <a id="page_151" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>proved impossible either to take such modernization further or to transfer the Regeneration to the national level. Many liberals were satisfied with the new status quo and did not want to see social change or the creation of a more unified Confederation , which might sap their newly found self-determination. It was also partly because not all cantons were willing to redress the old territorial imbalances in the way implied by the Regeneration. Thus in the early 1830s in Basle , the rural population, led by the young lawyer Stefan Gutzwiller , felt it had to push both for fair representation in the Grand Council of the regenerated canton and for free access to the city markets. When their New Year’s Day demands were not immediately accepted, the rurals set up a Provisional Governing Assembly of their own in Liestal , which was suppressed by the cantonal military. In response, the rurals refused to accept the revised Constitution – which offered only parity in representation – and continued their agitation. The city forces again attacked Liestal in August 1831, only to be driven off ignominiously, leaving thirteen dead behind them. The Diet then intervened with 4,000 troops to keep the two sides apart, thereby allowing the creation of a new Basle Country half-canton. The city refused to give up, and attempted a night attack on 6–7 April 1832, only to be defeated again at Gelterkinden. Ultimately, the Diet tacitly recognized separation, and withdrew its troops in the autumn of 1832. But the city remained intransigent, making a final military attempt to retain all its territories and privileges, only to be driven off with the loss of sixty-five militiamen at Pratteln and Liestal in early August 1833. All sides thereafter accepted the inevitability of having two half-cantons , and the city began revising its constitution accordingly.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-2036"><img src="../images/00035.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">5.3 </span>The Uster Fire of November 1832. The building seen burning down here was a mechanized weaving factory owned by Corrodi and Pfister in Oberuster in canton Zurich, the first of its kind there. There fire was started by local opponents of the mechanization of weaving, showing the social pressures underlying the Regeneration. Popular anger also owed something to the prevailing general reformist surge. The fire and the following proscription failed to prevent mechanized weaving from developing in the area which, by 1850, had the highest density of factories in Switzerland.</div>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-2037"><img src="../images/00036.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">5.4 </span>Stephan Gutzwiller chairing the Basle Country Constituent Assembly in 1831. The assembly met outdoors amid an enthusiastic crowd because the new half-canton had no premises. A thirty-year-old lawyer from Therwil, Gutzwiller was one of the dominant figures in the Regeneration in Basle, his support for equal rights helping to precipitate the rural segment’s secession. A reforming leader into the 1840s, he later became a leader of the conservative resistance to the democratic surge of the 1860s as supporters of reform split into radicals and moderates.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Territorial discrimination had been even more institutionalized in Schwyz, with the so-called Outer Districts being allowed only a third of seats in the Grand Council. Encouraged by the example of Basle, the latter established their own Landsgemeinde and created their own political entity, which was accepted as a half-canton by the Diet. When forces from the inner territories of Schwyz occupied Küssnacht in July 1833, the Diet intervened and sent 8,000 men to stop them. This, and a general dislike of splitting the canton, led the old territories to make concessions. Since the conservatives under Alois Ab Yberg , the canton’s largest landowner, remained in power, <a id="page_152" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>conflict continued throughout the 1830s. These two attempts at resisting change led seven of the reformed cantons to form a defensive alliance, the so-called <span class="italic">Siebnerkoncordat</span> , in May 1832. In response, on 16 November, five conservative cantons formed their own <span class="italic">Sarnerbund</span> in opposition, since they felt half-cantons were unconstitutional and probably impious as well. But after the failure of the conservative cause in Basle and Schwyz , the Diet was able to dissolve the special alliances. Nonetheless, hostility between the liberal and conservative camps persisted.</p>
<a id="page_153" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Moreover, at the same time a new division was emerging amongst supporters of the Regeneration as to whether its changes were the beginning or the end of the process of reform. Many of the new liberal regimes preferred to sit on their laurels, believing that ending absolutism was enough. They felt that any further change should be evolutionary, and should not involve the state intervening in the economy or providing social aid. Many among the liberals saw further democratization as a threat. Others sought further political progress through direct democracy and universal male suffrage, economic action to improve living standards and more secular education. Known as ‘advanced liberals’ or <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3720"><span class="italic">Freisinnige</span></a></span> or free thinkers, <a id="page_154" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>or more commonly as Radicals , their movement took on a limited organizational form thanks to the creation of the quasi-military Schütenzenverein in 1831, a secession from the Helvetic Society , and the 1835 National Association . Their educational ideas brought them into particular conflict with Catholic cantons , where the Church controlled schools and where conservatives quickly set up defensive organizations of their own to defend Catholic interests.</p>
<p class="calibre4">These developing conflicts fed into emerging contention over the nature of the new Confederation . National feeling had been much encouraged by the Regeneration , and early on, the Thurgau delegation to the Diet demanded a stronger government and judiciary. In July 1832 the idea was referred to a committee under Pellegrino Rossi , an exiled Italian academic. Its report suggested a modest step forward by creating a government with more resources and enhanced powers, while leaving cantonal sovereignty unchanged. This proved too extreme for conservatives, and even for some regenerated liberal governments like Vaud , but it was also too timid for radicals . Only nine cantons endorsed the proposals, and by October 1833, they were effectively dead. Nonetheless, the desire for a stronger national government and more muscular resistance to foreign intervention was far from dying.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Concern over foreign intervention in Swiss politics reflected the fact that despite army reforms and the appointment of Guillaume-Henri Dufour as Chief of Staff, Switzerland was subject to renewed external pressure. For example, Mazzini’s abortive radical invasion of Savoy in February 1834 prompted a blockade of Ticino. Later in the 1830s, fear of a French invasion arose when the Swiss refused to expel Louis-Napoleon, then an officer in the Thurgau militia , as demanded by the Orleanist monarchy. Foreign governments, spurred by the conservative forces gathered around the Austrian Chancellor Metternich , also called for tighter censorship and the expulsion of refugees from conservative repression. Resentment of such pressures helps to explain the formation of the Swiss Officers’ Society in 1833, and provided the impetus for further military reform. National feeling was also underwritten by the creation of national gymnastic and singing associations in 1832 and 1843. It was symptomatic that in 1841, Alberik Zwyssig from Uri wrote the ‘Swiss hymn’, which was eventually to replace Wyss’s <a id="page_155" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>composition as a national anthem. Such developments did not create an easy road to building a new nation and state , however. New factors were required to make good the failures of the liberalism and patriotism of the 1830s.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-2072"><span class="title">Religion, Radicalism and Civil War</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">In fact, from the 1830s, all these conflicts , like those over political reform, became increasingly entwined with religious questions. Rather than seeking a return to the Ancien Régime , conservatism became increasingly concerned with defending the rights of reviving Catholicism in face of the increasing strength of radicalism and nationalism. Since each side was willing to use violence to advance its cause, Catholic resistance first helped to tip the country into civil war , while its defeat in 1847 opened the way to the creation of Switzerland as a real federal state, rather than a loose Confederation .</p>
<p class="calibre4">The religious dimension first really came to the fore in 1834 when six regenerated cantons – ironically including Catholic cantons led by liberals – agreed to the Articles of Baden , which, in a search for an autonomous Swiss Catholic Church , laid down new rules on seminaries, marriages and feast days. Although the provisions were similar to those in many other Catholic countries, they were bitterly resisted in Switzerland because they conflicted with the increasingly fervent and political nature of conservative Swiss Catholicism and its proselytizing clergy. A symbol of this was Theodor Ab Yberg’s 1836 recall of the Jesuits and the papal nunciature to Schwyz.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Three years later, an even more dramatic expression of religious concern broke out in Protestant Zurich when peasants marched on the capital in the belief that ‘religion was in danger’. They were reacting to the liberal government’s appointment to a chair of theology of David Strauss , a German theologian who was known to doubt the divinity of Christ. The march, during which fourteen people died, brought about the downfall of the government, which was replaced by a resolutely anti-radical government under Johann Caspar Bluntschli. The Strauss affair also reinforced Catholic concerns about the direction the country was taking. Catholic activists were led by Joseph Leu of Ebersoll in Lucerne , a fervent and charismatic <a id="page_156" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Catholic layman who pushed for the rejection of the Baden Articles and also for the recall of the Jesuits. He founded a Catholic Brotherhood to defend the Church’s control of education, and helped to influence a new cantonal Constitution of 1841 in Lucerne that banned Protestantism. Catholic conservatives also moved against radical reforms in Valais and Ticino. A few in Lucerne, encouraged by the publications of Joseph Eutych Kopp, even began to doubt the legitimacy of Tell because he had been hostile to Austria, from where they hoped support would now come. However, generally speaking, both sides continued to paint themselves as his successors.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The looming confrontation was given an additional edge by the economic downturn of the 1840s, exacerbated in Switzerland by French protectionism and the creation of the German Customs Union (Zollverein). By 1843, there were 750,000 spindles in 150 firms, and mechanization was extending into ribbons, watches and cheese . Textile manufacture also stimulated development in chemicals and machine tools. These industries were concentrated in Schaffhausen and Zurich , while textiles dominated in the triangle between Aargau, Appenzell and Glarus. Agricultural improvement and the creation of technical schools also supported more intense manufactures. A quarter of the population came to be employed in industry, and Swiss achievements were much admired by John Bowring in his 1838 <span class="italic">Report to Parliament</span>. As prosperity increased, savings banks and assurance firms also multiplied. The 1840s downturn hit exports of cotton fabric very badly . The decline caused pauperism and other social problems, which in turn stimulated the first cooperatives and quasi-trade unions, such as the 1838 Grütlianer educational body, and it also reinforced radical ideas of interventionism and even early socialist ideas. The downturn also encouraged business to think of creating its own Zollverein and a government that could establish a proper railway policy. In 1847, only one line existed from Zurich to Baden (the so-called Spanisch-Brötli Bahn, or Spanish Rolls Railway), which whisked soft fresh bread from Baden bakers to Zurich customers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although economic tensions were important, it was religious issues that drove political contention and the final establishment of national unity. The trigger for the critical events of 1847–8 was <a id="page_157" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>provided by Augustin Keller , a liberal Catholic from Aargau who believed that a Catholic Church subject to the Vatican could not be free. He and the cantonal government rewrote the cantonal constitution in 1841 in a way that exacerbated the minority position of the Catholics in the Freiamt and elsewhere. They responded with a peasant march on Aarau , the capital, which the cantonal government forcibly blocked at Villmergen . In retaliation, the government ordered the closure of the eight convents in the canton, which they suspected of having fomented revolt, even though these enjoyed specific guarantees in the 1815 Charter. Understandably, the monks’ expulsion and the state’s seizure of their property led to protests. Although the Diet helped get four nunneries restored, some Catholic leaders started talking about leaving the Confederation . In fact, the Catholic leadership held talks in September 1843 about organizing themselves militarily and disassociating themselves from cantons like Aargau that broke the Charter. Extremists like Leu also used the moment to push through the recall of the Jesuits to Lucerne.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Such Catholic actions served as a red rag to the radical bull, especially when, after a civil struggle, the Valais conservatives imposed a new constitution that excluded French -speakers from power and banned Protestantism. A major radical mobilization followed, allowing new regimes to come to power in many cantons. In 1845 Henri Druey , the firebrand head of the National Association , and the radicals overthrew the liberal Vaudois regime because it was too weak on the Jesuit question. In Ticino Radicals saw off a conservative onslaught and introduced a new constitution restricting the rights of the Church. And in Zurich and Berne, conservative regimes were also voted out and more radical ones installed, with a new constitution in the latter in July 1846. Geneva also came under pressure from the 3 March movement of James Fazy , which used the Jesuit question as a lever. By the time the Aargau government demanded that the Diet ban the Jesuits, the whole country was divided.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The radicals also tried to overthrow the conservative regime in Lucerne from within, but failed. As a result, they and their allies resorted to violence: 1,000 volunteers or <span class="italic">Freischaren</span> from Aargau, Basle Country and Solothurn marched on Lucerne. Failing to attract <a id="page_158" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>much support, they retreated, even though they had defeated a federal force sent to stop them. A second onslaught by 3,500 volunteers under Ulrich Ochsenbein of Berne in late March 1845 was even more unsuccessful, being outmanoeuvred and crushed with the loss of 100 dead and 1,800 prisoners. The resort to violence proved counter-productive, since the Ultramontanes, or enthusiasts for papal power, came to power in Lucerne elections so that tensions only increased.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-2125"><img src="../images/00037.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">5.5 </span>The second Freischarenzug (or Free Corps raid) defeated in Lucerne, 31 March 1845: 3,500 anti-clerical free-corps activists under Ulrich Ochsenbein of Berne set out from Zofingen and Huttwil and, despite a check at Emmenbrücke, reached the walls of Lucerne. But they failed to push on and take the town, allowing local forces to pick them off with heavy losses. The attack envenomed relations between radicals and conservatives, helping to encourage armed Catholic resistance to change.</div>
<a id="page_159" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Four months later a former <span class="italic">Freischaren</span> trooper murdered Leu, possibly at Radical instigation. This caused panic in Catholic ranks. Not merely did Gallus Baumgartner of St Gallen found a Catholic Association, ostensibly to defend the 1815 Charter , but in December, seven cantons – Fribourg, Lucerne, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Uri , Valais and Zug – signed a security pact establishing a war council and making contacts with friendly Great Powers. Implicitly, they were also signing up to Siegwart-Müller’s ideas of manufacturing a new built-in majority for (enlarged) Catholic cantons. The existence of this so-called <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3739">Sonderbund</a></span> (or special alliance) was revealed during ratification debates in Fribourg the following June.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Shortly after it became public, ten cantons called for the dissolution of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3739">Sonderbund</a></span>. This was short of the necessary cantonal majority in the Diet, but after Fazy overthrew the liberal regime in Geneva in May 1847, and St Gallen , ‘the canton of destiny’, unexpectedly voted in a Radical legislature, the majority at the Diet was achieved. When the Diet met again on 5 July, Ochsenbein, the former leader of the <span class="italic">Freischaren</span> then chairing the Diet, made it clear the Radicals were intent on a stronger Swiss state and firmer resistance to the Great Powers. On 20 July, the Diet formally called for the disbanding of the Sonderbund and the expulsion of the Jesuits , and set up a committee to oversee the problem. It also decided to revise the Charter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rather than accept such changes, the Sonderbund began organizing for war, appointing the reluctant Johann-Ulrich von Salis-Soglio , a Grisons Protestant, as its commander. Unfortunately for them, arms supplied by France and the Italian states were intercepted, while Austria held back its support, whereas Britain supported the Diet . Several attempts at peace negotiations failed, and on 24 October 1847, the Diet took the decision to dissolve the Sonderbund by force, and ordered the mobilization of 50,000 men under Dufour . In fact 100,000 rallied to the flag, despite some Catholic mutinies. Dufour kept close control of strategy, whereas the Sonderbund, with less than half the troops, allowed its War Council to overrule Salis-Soglio by going on the offensive both in the Freiamt, where they were rapidly defeated on 12 November, and on the Gotthard, where initial gains were not followed up, partly because the Catholic troops did not like fighting outside their own cantons.</p>
<a id="page_160" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Dufour ignored these distractions and struck first at Fribourg , which capitulated after a few skirmishes on 14 November. He then moved on Zug , which fell on 21 November. This allowed him to concentrate on Lucerne , the heart of the Sonderbund. Although the latter’s forces defeated Dufour’s army at Gislikon and Meierskappell, they were eventually broken by his artillery, allowing Lucerne to be invested. With this, the Sonderbund collapsed. As in Fribourg, new radical governments were installed in Zug , Lucerne and Valais. In all the hostilities, some 130 were killed and 300 wounded. Significantly, the fighting ended before the Great Powers managed to intervene or ‘mediate’ . Only in January 1848 did they demand that the Diet respect the Charter, but British influence and the outbreak of revolution in Paris, Vienna and Berlin that spring blocked any further action. Taking advantage of the disruptions elsewhere, the republicans in Neuchâtel were thus able to eject their Prussian rulers in early March 1848.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Diet made the Sonderbund cantons pay the 20 million francs the war had cost, and pressed on with constitutional revisions, which it had suspended during the civil war . Refusing merely to revise the Charter, the Diet went back to the Rossi draft to facilitate a fresh start. Its committee, with Druey and Johann Konrad Kern, the dominant politician in Thurgau, drafting the French and German texts, made rapid progress and produced a text in April. This was amended by the Diet over the next few weeks and accepted on 27 June, with only three and a half cantons dissenting. What the Diet produced, essentially as a result of military victory, was a real constitution that set up a federal state, even though it used the term Confederation . Central to the new constitution was the creation of an effective national government, although the bicameral legislature and the requirement for a double majority on important votes sought to reconcile national aspirations with cantonal sovereignty and the unease of the Catholic cantons.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Most cantons approved the new text by referendum , and by late September, fifteen and a half cantons had ratified it, against six and a half that rejected: in votes, the tally was 146,000 votes to 54,300. This margin was narrower than it appears, given that abstentions were again sometimes counted as votes in favour. The Diet proceeded to elect the first government, and dissolved itself. The new <a id="page_161" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>constitution was a clear victory for Radical views and the culmination of a real revolution. Even so, while Switzerland was perhaps the only place in Europe where 1848 did lead to the creation of a successful radical-democratic state, the Swiss were still left facing many challenging problems, including how to deal with the Catholic question and the new form of contention it involved.</p>
