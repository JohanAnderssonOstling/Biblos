<p class="noindent">Around 1400, the loosely organized <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718"><span class="italic">Eidgenossenschaft</span></a></span> or Confederacy of rural and urban communes, bolstered by mutual support at moments of crisis and by a few agreements on jurisdiction and military affairs, had become significant political players in the region stretching from Lake Geneva to Lake Constance . A century later <span class="italic">c</span>. 1500, a widely recognized Swiss Confederacy negotiated treaties with the Habsburg Emperors, the kings of France and other major European powers about military cooperation and dominion over northern Italy . Repeated wars as well as profound changes in the European political milieu and in relations among the Swiss themselves made this unexpected transformation possible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Across Europe, leagues that began as desperate efforts to control violence in the High Middle Ages showed themselves capable – especially in Italy , the western German lands and the Netherlands – of evolving into stable political alliances with offensive and defensive capacities. The thriving Italian city-states in the fourteenth century proved that communal polities could become politically dominant; as they demonstrated in the fifteenth century, they could also produce new nobilities and revert to aristocratic government. The <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718"><span class="italic">Eidgenossenschaft</span></a></span> of the Swiss followed a different path. The small size of the units involved – Zurich and Berne were tiny compared to Florence and Milan – and the combination of rural and urban communes made the Swiss Confederacy distinctive. Moreover, aristocratic dynasties remained vital in the north beyond 1400, including the Habsburgs and Savoy along with <a id="page_41" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_42" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>regional houses like the Toggenburg and Württemberg, meaning that the Confederacy’s members could survive only through cooperation and mutual support. By 1500, however, despite the persistently diverse interests among its members, it was the Confederacy as a whole, rather than Berne or Zurich or Schwyz , that had become significant on a European scale.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-526"><img src="../images/00011.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">2.1 </span>Swearing to the alliances. Mutual oaths among communal members provided a potent alternative to lordly dominion in the late 1300s and early 1400s. In this image, citizens of Lucerne swear to uphold the Confederate alliance of 1351, documented in the charter held by the figure upper right. Swiss consciousness of how their alliances, and the oaths they took to protect them, constituted their Confederacy appears in this depiction of oath-swearing from an illustrated chronicle produced in early sixteenth-century Lucerne.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Growing polarization between the emerging Confederacy and the region’s dynasts – above all, the Habsburg family, who permanently regained the imperial throne in 1438 – added an ideological dimension to political contestation. Most contemporaries equated the Confederacy’s usurpation of Habsburg and other noble territories with the peasant rebellions that all European nobles feared; from the Swiss perspective, aristocratic efforts to suppress communal privileges demonstrated that the region’s dynasts had become tyrants worthy of deposition by the pious common man. A nearly unbroken sequence of Swiss military and political successes from 1386 to 1499 heightened such tensions, and led defenders of the Confederacy to produce songs, myths and histories intended to legitimate the new political entity that was taking shape. Composed mostly after 1450, this material reflected the circumstances of the 1400s, even though most of the events it reported, including the increasingly iconic story of William Tell , were set around 1300.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This body of literary and historical material – what Swiss call the ‘saga of liberation’ (<span class="italic">Befreiungssage</span> ) – is significant in understanding both Swiss history and modern Swiss political culture, since it became the accepted foundation for political discussions among the Swiss for the next five centuries. Urban patricians in the 1500s, rebellious rural communes in 1653, Enlightenment intellectuals in the early 1700s and political activists in the era of the French Revolution all referred to William Tell’s fight against Habsburg tyranny. Modern historical research has established that the saga included many events that either never took place, such as the rebellion of William Tell, or which were described anachronistically. Nevertheless, its emergence must be included among the transformations of the long fifteenth century that produced a coherent Confederacy .</p>
<a id="page_43" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><h3 class="sec" id="c19444-538"><span class="title">The European Context</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The events that produced a lasting Swiss Confederacy in the 1400s can only be understood in their larger European context. Across Europe , central authorities of all kind faced enormous challenges around 1400, since political fragmentation and local lawlessness were widespread. Major wars affected most European states, while repeated popular rebellions created great anxiety among feudal aristocrats. The demographic and economic consequences of the Black Death , which kept populations down and labour scarce well into the 1400s, exacerbated conflict. After about 1470, however, the balance tilted across Europe. This can be seen most vividly in the consolidation of powerful ‘new monarchies ’ in France , England and Spain . Characterized by bureaucratic administration, standing armies and significant representative institutions, these new monarchies created the foundations for early modern and modern European states. In Italy , the city-states mostly became hereditary principalities – the major exception being Venice; in the Empire, territorial principalities played a growing role in politics and society, while the Empire’s own institutions expanded in the imperial reform of 1495. Political consolidation was accompanied by increasingly rigid social hierarchies and a new wave of repression directed against those who diverged from Christian i deals. At the same time, intellectual innovation beginning in Italy transformed education , religion and eventually elite culture as a whole, as Renaissance ideas spread across Europe.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Swiss developments closely followed European trends, although Switzerland’s location near several hotspots of European contention, including the nascent Burgundian realm and northern Italy, put particular pressure on the Confederacy’s members while lending the entire Confederacy greater European salience. Six major episodes of conflict transformed the Confederacy between 1386 and 1500 and illustrate its development. The first two, which continued the trends of the late 1300s, fit the European pattern of weakened traditional authorities and aggressive new political actors. The Appenzell wars of 1403–9 belong among the most significant and successful peasant rebellions in a rebellious era, while the Swiss seizure of the Aargau from the Habsburgs in 1415–19 demonstrated the strength <a id="page_44" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718"><span class="italic">Eidgenossenschaft</span></a></span> ’s network of alliances. The third conflict, the Old Zurich War of 1436–50, was a complex affair involving dynastic politics, Swiss–Habsburg relations and rivalries within the Confederacy itself. These first three conflicts also deeply influenced the narratives of Swiss liberation that were emerging around 1450.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The last three conflicts – the Burgundian War of 1474–7, the Swabian War of 1499 and finally Swiss involvement in the Italian Wars after 1494 – show that the Confederacy had become a significant player in European politics (more significant, indeed, than it would be in later periods). In each of these conflicts, however, the internally conflicted nature of the Confederacy also became evident. Shared institutions and shared agreements helped manage these circumstances, and also reveal how the Confederacy was evolving. In particular, the emergence of a Swiss Diet , the <span class="italic">Tagsatzung</span>, after 1420; the treaties that ended the Old Zurich war in the early 1450s; and the <span class="italic">Stanser Verkommnis</span> of 1481, together with the acceptance of Fribourg and Solothurn as members of the Confederacy , document the emerging outlines of the Swiss polity as it existed from the early 1500s until 1798.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-563"><span class="title">Consolidation and Revolution, 1386–1415</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The loose Swiss Confederacy that existed in 1386 could grow because of weakness among both the local and higher nobility in the region. This weakness allowed the urban cantons , especially Berne , to expand their territories through purchase, mortgage and other tactics, thus bringing more and more subjects under their governance. The rural cantons sought expansion as well: notably, Uri signed a protection agreement with the Leventina valley south of the St Gotthard pass, and in cooperation with the other Inner Swiss pressed its influence further south, initiating the century-long process of appropriating the valley of the Ticino .</p>
<p class="calibre4">The emergence of an aggressive peasant movement in the hills of Appenzell provides a vivid demonstration of how limited noble power was around 1400. Like other rural areas, the inhabitants of Appenzell had established corporately organized economic and legal communes in the 1300s. In 1377, these communes became members of the Swabian league of cities, along with the city of St Gallen , which <a id="page_45" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>shared in the region’s thriving linen manufactures and subjection to the Abbot of St Gallen . When a new abbot, Kuno von Stoffel, sought to restore the abbey’s control over – and its income from – its subjects after 1379, the peasants insisted the abbot was violating ‘old traditions’. They therefore systematically withheld death dues, married non-subjects and otherwise ignored his commands. Resistance from Appenzell and St Gallen led Kuno to put his abbey under Habsburg protection. The Appenzellers responded by destroying their bailiff’s castle and allying with Schwyz , which took charge of military affairs. The peasant militia inflicted a series of humiliating defeats on the abbatial and Habsburg forces at Voglinsegg in 1403 and at the Stoss in 1405, inspiring a wave of excitement among the Habsburg-ruled peasantry of the region around Lake Constance . As one contemporary report put it, ‘All the peasants would gladly be Appenzellers.’ A struggle over feudal dues and administration had provoked a social revolution.</p>
<p class="calibre4">From 1404 to 1408, a Bund ob dem See (Alliance above the Lake) centred on Appenzell and its Schwyzer allies destroyed castles and drove out noble administrators around the region. The new alliance aimed at creating a peasant confederacy of remarkable size, and resembles the contemporary Hussite rebellion in Bohemia. However, though the Appenzellers ignored episcopal and papal condemnations, their movement lacked the religious dimension that welded the Bohemian rebels into a lasting movement. A minor defeat at Bregenz , inflicted by the Swabian noble-communal league of St Jörgenschild, ended the seeming invincibility of the Appenzell militia, after which truces and legal judgments terminated open hostilities. On paper, Appenzell returned to obedience to the abbot, but in reality, the commune remained autonomous. The members of the Swiss Confederacy took a limited part in these events. Schwyz , whose territorial interests lay towards Appenzell, provided support and military leadership at crucial moments; Zurich counselled peace, mediated and sought to stabilize its own hinterland to prevent the movement from spreading.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Appenzell was not the only region where mountain communities expelled regional lords in this period. In the upper Rhone valley, seven valley communities collaborated to limit Savoy ard influence by expelling the lords of Raron and gaining oversight over the Bishops of Sion . In the Grisons , ministerial noble families like the Planta and <a id="page_46" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>commoner elites built a network of communal alliances between 1367 and 1446. The League of the House of God limited the Bishop of Chur , while the Grey League extended a regional peace alliance at the headwaters of the Rhine by establishing a common court and regular assemblies. Joined by the League of the Ten Jurisdictions after 1436, these leagues formed a separate confederacy in the Grisons that became a lasting ally of the Swiss.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Each of these rural movements rested on the leadership of elites who were neither poor nor unsophisticated, and who often had ties to the existing aristocratic system and to nearby urban communes . Earlier Swiss historians often ascribed democratic practices and legitimacy to these movements, and to the emerging Confederacy as a whole, in ways that the evidence does not support. Only a limited number of citizens had political rights in Swiss political corporations, and even where most arms-bearing males could attend public assemblies, a few clans typically monopolized offices and controlled most decisions. Still, communal leaders – even those carrying noble titles – gained legitimacy from their communes , rather than from aristocratic status. Communal support for leadership, especially in the rural cantons, and the very real rejection of noble prerogatives that drove many of these movements also encouraged the increasing ideological divide between nobles and commoners – whom the nobles derogated as ‘coarse peasants’ regardless of their status or authority. This divide shaped both events and the historical mythology of the Confederacy .</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-610"><span class="title">Imperial Politics, the Aargau and The Swiss Diet, 1415–1436</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The seizure of the Aargau in 1415 brought a key strategic territory under Swiss control and simultaneously spurred the creation of the Confederacy’ s first formal institutions. The Aargau lies at the very centre of the Swiss midlands where the Aar , Reuss and Limmat rivers meet – flowing from Berne , Lucerne and Zurich – and there lay the Habichtsburg , the castle that gave the Habsburg family its name. The Habsburgs had comital rights in the Aargau after 1173, and by 1415, much of the Aargau was under direct administration of a Habsburg bailiff in the town of Baden .</p>
<a id="page_47" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">In 1415, Emperor Sigismund called a church council in Constance to end the papal schism, in which three rival popes each claimed to be the sole head of the church in Rome . The schism divided western Christendom from the 1370s, since everyone faced the choice of which Pope to support. The council summoned the claimants in the intention of deposing them all; when the Habsburg duke Frederick IV helped one claimant escape, Sigismund seized this welcome opportunity to weaken his Habsburg rival by invoking the imperial ban and inviting Frederick’s enemies to seize his territories. The leaders of Berne had long had their eyes on the strategic and prosperous region down the Aar from the city, and swiftly seized the western Aargau . The other Confederates hesitated, but when promised further privileges from Sigismund, seized the eastern and southern Aargau. Resistance was modest, and soon the Confederates were the (slightly dubious) lords over the Aargau. The validity of the Confederates’ title was subject to the vicissitudes of Habsburg–imperial relations, but payment to Sigismund of 10,000 gulden to mortgage several crucial lordships provided a legal foundation sufficient to make the Aargau permanently Swiss.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Possession of this strategic territory was of great importance; the challenge of administering the Aargau, which became not a member but a <span class="italic">subject</span> of the Confederacy, had equally lasting consequences. The Bernese quickly absorbed the territory they had seized, but the areas that had been taken jointly formed a condominium. After some poorly documented experimentation, the seven participating cantons began jointly appointing a chief magistrate for their shared territories, with the power of appointment rotating biennially. This officer, the <span class="italic">Landvogt</span> , collected taxes, administered high justice and called out the local militia in the name of the seven cantons. Although the Confederates confirmed the liberties and privileges of the Aargau’s inhabitants, governance was founded entirely on the basis of lordship.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Significantly, the cantons decided to make policy for their new subjects by majority vote among the conquerors. Although the Aargau produced only modest revenues, the necessity of inspecting each <span class="italic">Landvogt</span>’s accounts and of swearing in the new incumbent also meant that representatives of the cantons had to meet regularly, which they began doing in the town of Baden. From these beginnings, the <a id="page_48" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Swiss Diet (the <span class="italic">Tagsatzung</span>) emerged. In contrast to other parliaments appearing at the time, the Diet rested not on the three estates of the clergy, nobility and commoners, but rather on corporate states that sent delegates bound by instructions from home. The meetings provided the occasion to discuss other shared concerns, although unanimity was required for any decisions not related to the condominiums . Regular Diets ensured that the leading politicians in the cantons knew each other and became familiar with their allies’ situations, and provided a valuable forum both for mediation of conflicts and for military planning later in the century.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Acquisition of lordship over the Aargau was thus a decisive step for the loosely organized Confederacy of the fourteenth century. It closed a strategic territorial gap between Berne and the eastern Confederates, drawing Berne and its existing network of alliances closer to the rest of the Confederacy – especially since Berne now possessed a substantial slice of usurped Habsburg territory, thus aligning its political interests more closely with the anti-Habsburg central and eastern cantons. Increasing coherence in the Confederacy also generated conflict, however. The territorial interests of the individual cantons – still fully autonomous beyond the pacts that connected them – began impinging not only on neighbouring lordships, but also on other Confederates. Major disputes in the Valais and in Zug in the 1420s threatened the Confederacy when various ties put members on opposite sides. Greater territorial integrity also raised the question of how far the Confederacy as a whole could bind the actions of its individual members. The actual pacts connecting the members dated back to the fourteenth century, and addressed such questions only vaguely if at all. <span class="italic">Ad hoc</span> solutions overcame some potential internal conflicts, but these issues nearly destroyed the Confederacy during the struggle from 1436 into the 1450s known as the Old Zurich War (<span class="italic">Alter Zürichkrieg</span>).</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-639"><span class="title">Contesting the Nature of the Confederacy, 1436–1460</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Instability characterized most of Europe from the 1420s to the 1450s. Particularly in south-west Germany, where authority was deeply fragmented, public order was tenuous and armed feuding ubiquitous. <a id="page_49" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Compared to Germany, the peace alliances of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718"><span class="italic">Eidgenossenschaft</span></a></span> succeeded in limiting public violence, but a serious economic slowdown in the 1430s and 1440s hit them as well. It was a dangerous time for small political entities, but also offered opportunities. Indeed, Zurich and Berne used their financial resources to expand their territorial holdings during these years at the expense of the remaining petty nobility. Schwyz , too, sought control over the pass trade through the <a id="page_50" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Grisons by reaching out to the southern end of Lake Zurich, fuelling a rivalry with Zurich that would last several centuries. Zurich and Schwyz both courted the Count of Toggenburg , the last major feudal dynast in eastern Switzerland. Well into the early 1400s, the counts kept accumulating strategic inheritances, but it became clear by the 1420s that the last count would have no direct heir. The rivalry for Count Frederick VII’s favour, and thus for his lands, became more and more virulent until his death in 1436 unleashed open war inside and outside the Confederacy .</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-653"><img src="../images/00012.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">2.2 </span>Deathbed of Frederick VII of Toggenburg. Although the Habsburgs lost ground in the Confederacy after 1400, major dynasts such as Frederick controlled wide swathes of territory in the region. When Frederick died in 1436 without a will or direct heir, his conflicting promises and alliances, and the strategic placement of his domains in eastern Switzerland, provoked the Old Zurich War of 1436–50, which nearly destroyed the Confederacy.</div>
<p class="calibre4">The struggle over the Toggenburg legacy was bitter, but a second dynastic event made it an existential threat to the Confederacy: in 1438, Albrecht II Habsburg , son-in-law of Sigismund, became Emperor, initiating 300 years of Habsburg sovereigns. Not since 1308 had the Swiss faced a Habsburg Emperor who combined in one person both imperial authority and his family’s claims in the region. The truce between the Confederacy and the Habsburgs after 1386 had resolved nothing, nor had the Habsburgs ever accepted their loss of the Aargau in 1415. Although Albrecht soon died, he was succeeded by his cousin Frederick III, who was intent on restoring his family’s possessions, and thus refused to confirm the imperial privileges of the Swiss. Frederick’s desire to regain the Aargau and other lost domains turned a local feud into a war that eventually involved France and the south German princes as well as the Swiss.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The war, largely consisting of raids, skirmishes and attacks on peasants, fell into two phases. From 1436 to 1442, Zurich’ s high hopes of obtaining substantial territories from the Toggenburg inheritance were dashed by the bold actions that Ital Reding, long-term <span class="italic">Landamman</span> (chief magistrate) of Schwyz , took to seize several critical territories. Reding ’s hostility to Zurich gained support from Berne during a series of arbitrations undertaken by the Confederates: the Bernese leaders apparently felt that Zurich was a greater rival than rural Schwyz, and tilted the arbitrations toward the latter. Meanwhile, Habsburg administrators moved aggressively to re-establish control over critical parts of the upper Rhine valley, whose lordship they claimed after the extinction of the Toggenburger. Zurich’s troops were defeated in a few skirmishes, its limited gains of 1436 were reversed and increasingly onerous penalties weighed on the city.</p>
<a id="page_51" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Hedged in, Zurich turned to the new Emperor, Frederick III , who boldly proposed a grand bargain: with imperial support, Zurich would obtain large parts of the Toggenburg inheritance; in exchange, Zurich would cede its recent acquisitions from the Counts of Kyburg to the Habsburgs, and support full Habsburg restitution in the Aargau . The deal would be enforced by a new eastern confederation including Zurich , St Gallen , Appenzell and the Habsburgs, which would neutralize the dangerous Swiss and bring the region into the Habsburg sphere of influence. Challenged by its allies for making an alliance with the ‘hereditary enemy’, Zurich’s negotiators pointed to <a id="page_52" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>the diplomatic freedom that the city retained in its old alliances with the Confederates, and insisted that the pact with Austria reflected its rights as a free imperial city.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-673"><img src="../images/00013.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">2.3 </span>Battle of St Jakob an der Sihl. Although they defeated Zurich and Habsburg troops outside the city at the chapel of St Jakob in July 1443, the coalition headed by Schwyz and supported by Berne was unable to take Zurich itself. A bloody stalemate with incessant raiding of the peasantry and numerous atrocities ensued. The bitterness of the struggles, which spread across eastern Switzerland, delayed a final peace and reconsolidation of the Confederacy until 1450.</div>
<p class="calibre4">The possibility that the Habsburgs might regain hegemony over their south-western lordships became a matter of European concern. In the Empire, the electoral princes (<span class="italic">Kurfürsten</span>) supported the Confederacy as a way to limit Habsburg power, while Frederick formed an alliance with the King of France , who was eager to find distraction outside France for the mercenaries, known as <span class="italic">Armagnacs</span>, released by the waning of the Hundred Years War . Zurich experienced a major defeat in July 1443 at St Jakob an der Sihl. A Confederate army overran a force consisting of city militia, Swabia n nobles and Habsburg cavalry, Mayor Stüssi was killed and a long siege ensued. In the summer of 1444, an Armagnac force marched towards Alsace and Switzerland to subdue Basle and support Zurich. It was met outside Basle by a hastily assembled force of about 1,500 troops from Berne and Solothurn : nearly all the Swiss were killed, but the French pulled back and played no further part in the struggle. Widespread skirmishing and devastation continued, along with several minor battles in which Confederate forces defeated various combinations of Habsburg and local troops, but failed to capture many towns or fortified places.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The war was accompanied by a wave of propaganda from all sides. For the Confederates, Zurich’s plan for a new anti-Confederacy under Habsburg hegemony constituted betrayal. Frederick appealed for French assistance by evoking ‘the dangerous example of servants rising up against their masters, and peasants against the nobles’, while the Zurich cleric Felix Hemmerli circulated a polemic against Swiss rebels, whom he described as ‘coarse, gluttonous, wrinkled, rough and with strangely shaped bodies’. Such increasingly clear polarization between the ‘Swiss ’ – seen as peasants, for better or for worse – and the lords found a reflection in the Swiss liberation narrative when it was first written down in the 1470s by men who had experienced the Old Zurich War.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although fighting petered out after 1446, the intense animosity that had developed between the partie s delayed a final settlement for years. Finally, after a series of complicated arbitrations, in which Berne played a decisive role, a peace was reached. Zurich received <a id="page_53" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>back almost all of the territory it had lost, but the Toggenburg inheritance went to other claimants, including Glarus and Schwyz . The most important clause subjected Zurich (and all the Confederates) to mediation if their actions impinged on the shared alliance: henceforth, the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718"><span class="italic">Eidgenossenschaft</span></a></span> would have priority over each canton’s right to make alliances . In the wake of the peace, several original alliances from the fourteenth century were reissued under the original dates, but missing crucial clauses protecting Habsburg authority; the originals were destroyed. A loose network of alliances had become a binding confederacy of partners .</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Old Zurich War represented a key turning point in the fate of this region. Had Zurich built up its own rival confederation in partnership with the Habsburgs , it is hard to imagine that the Swiss network would have survived the coming centuries of turmoil. Three other important features of the Swiss situation also became visible during the conflict. First, under the conditions of fifteenth-century warfare , no noble or urban military force was capable of defeating the Swiss . The events of the following half-century would repeatedly confirm this fact, until the emergence of artillery and modern fortifications. Second, the Confederacy had become the key territorial power in the region north of the Central Alps , just as principalities were becoming the key territorial powers further north and further south. The Confederacy would deal with Visconti and Sforza Milan , with the Dukes of Württemberg and with the Habsburgs as territorial peers. Finally, while future conflicts within the Confederacy often began with events in Zurich or in the mountains, their resolution would remain impossible until Berne took sides. As the largest and eventually richest canton, with a close-knit aristocratic urban elite in charge, Berne had become the arbiter of the Confederacy.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-701"><span class="title">The Confederacy and its Neighbours, 1460–1499</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Old Zurich War produced a more integrated Confederacy , changing both political balances within the cantons as well as their relationship with neighbouring powers. In consequence, the political issues during the half-century after 1450 had a different flavour. In place of <a id="page_54" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>territorial consolidation of individual cantons through piecemeal acquisition, outright conquest and the accession of new members characterized the period to 1536, when Swiss western expansion reached its modern limits with Berne ’s seizure of the Vaud and Geneva ’s entry as an associate. The new members included Fribourg and Solothurn (1481), followed by Schaffhausen, Basle (both 1501) and finally Appenzell , which became a full member in 1513. Ambitious efforts to expand south of the Alps remained confined to the Alpine foothills: the III Grisons Leagues seized the Valtellina in 1512 and held it until the Napoleonic period, the Ticino valley came under Swiss sovereignty in the form of several condominiums, while the Val d’Ossola slipped back out of Swiss hands before 1500. Territorial expansion and the consolidation of the great powers around Switzerland led to regional wars that included two spectacular Swiss victories, first against Burgundy in 1476–7, then against the Habsburgs and Empire in 1499. Expansion and victory altered the balance of power inside the Confederacy , along with the social and political balance between each canton’s elite (which gained in influence and wealth) and the body of the citizenry. These issues reached a crisis in 1481, and were resolved in the <span class="italic">Stanser Verkommnis</span> , which accelerated the consolidation of the cantons as sovereign and territorially defined polities.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-720"><img src="../images/00014.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">Map 2.1 </span>The early Confederacy</div>
<p class="calibre4">The events between 1458 and 1460 that brought the Thurgau under Swiss jurisdiction illustrate how the issues described above were intertwined. In particular, the role of autonomous bands of militarily trained men from various cantons – often only tenuously controlled by the magistrates – was critical, and reveals how mercenary experience was shifting the political forces within the Confederacy. The first phase of the Swiss takeover was the so-called Plappart War of 1458. As described in later sources, the rejection of a Bernese coin sporting the image of a bear (a <span class="italic">Plappart</span>) during a festival in Constance as a mere ‘cow-plappart’ triggered outrage among the Swiss attendees. The accusation showed the growing divide in identity between the Swiss and their neighbours in Swabia , perhaps accentuated by the insinuation of bestiality in the term of abuse ‘cow-Swiss’. The insult provoked an impromptu band of troops to savage the Thurgau (under the jurisdiction of Constance at the time) and to demand reparations for their honour. The band had official support from Lucerne , although <a id="page_55" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_56" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>men from a number of cantons participated; on their way home, they triggered a pro-Swiss coup in the Habsburg town of Rapperswil , divided between a loyalist faction known as ‘Christians’ and a pro-Swiss faction known as ‘Turks’. In September 1460, irregular troops from Unterwalden and Lucerne again marched into the Thurgau after declaring a feud against the Habsburgs. To curb the movement, the remaining cantons sent their own contingents, and the territory quickly fell into Swiss hands. The Thurgau quickly re-emerged as a condominium under the same arrangements as the Aargau . Sigismund of Habsburg sold the now isolated city of Winterthur to Zurich in 1467, closing the remaining gap in Swiss control in this region. Direct action by militarily experienced citizens brought territorial additions to the Swiss, but their lawlessness and disrespect for existing hierarchies caused both urban and rural elites considerable anxiety.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Such matters were overshadowed in the 1470s by larger shifts in Western Europe . One legacy of the Hundred Years War between France and England was the uncertain status of Burgundy, which by the mid-1400s included territories stretching from the northern Netherlands down to the County of Burgundy around Besançon. The Valois Dukes who assembled these lands had their eyes on a crown for their ‘middle realm’, and energetically expanded their holdings to this end, funded by the prosperous Low Countries. Their ambitions were alternatively useful and alarming to the Kings of France and the German Emperors, but they were a direct threat to many small domains in their path, among which Berne , immediately to the south-east of the County of Burgundy, was significant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Charles the Bold’s accession as Duke triggered a complex series of diplomatic realignments that led, ultimately, to major Swiss participation in the struggles that destroyed Charles and his hopes. Both Sigismund of Habsburg, regent of his family’s western holdings and King Louis XI of France, alarmed at Charles’s ambitions, played critical roles. Sigismund initially sought Burgundian assistance against the Swiss, paid for by mortgaging his territories in Alsace to Charles. As his doubts about Charles’s intentions grew, however, Sigismund changed sides and reached a long-term accommodation with the Swiss in 1474 that accepted Habsburg’s territorial losses to the Confederacy – an astonishing concession – in exchange for support against the Burgundian possession of Alsace. Not coincidentally, Louis <a id="page_57" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>helped negotiate this treaty’s terms, which made conflict between Charles and the Bernese, reluctantly supported by the rest of the Confederacy, inevitable. After a series of skirmishes and Berne’s seizure of the Vaud from Charles’ ally Savoy in 1475, the three major battles at Grandson , Murten and Nancy went from bad to worse for the Burgundians. At Grandson on 2 March 1476, a Burgundian army under Charles’s personal command was driven back and his luxurious baggage train captured (major pieces remain in the Bernese Historical Museum and other Swiss museums). At Murten, a few months later, Charles lost half of his army, some 9,000, against a few hundred Swiss losses. Finally, at Nancy on 5 January 1477, a unified Lotharingian–Swiss–Alsatian army destroyed Charles’s forces and killed the Duke himself. One of the most dynamic and ambitious potentates in Europe had fallen to the Confederacy , dramatically raising its stature as a potential ally.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Military and political success put the nature and extent of the Confederacy into question in new ways. During the war, the Confederacy gave little support to Berne ’s expansionist agenda, and afterwards, the eastern cantons refused to back Berne, ensuring that neither the Vaud nor the County of Burgundy remained in Swiss hands, though Fribourg did move closer to the Confederacy. Moreover, as the French negotiators quickly learned, cash directed to individual leaders or to a canton’s common treasury was usually sufficient to bring about policies they desired. Greater Swiss power, it turned out, meant greater opportunities for corruption and internal disputes. Meanwhile, a growing divide between urban and rural areas enhanced the centripetal forces in the Confederacy . City magistrates already feared the undisciplined ‘free companies’ of young men, like those who had ravaged the Thurgau. Similar spontaneous cavalcades culminated in the ‘Sow-banner campaign’ (<span class="italic">Saubannerzug</span>) of 1477, when some 1,700 ex-soldiers, mostly from Inner Switzerland, marched to Geneva to demand the pay they had been promised for service during the Burgundian war . Behind their banner – whose symbols of the boar and the club symbolized popular unrest – lay not only anger at being cheated out of loot at Nancy, but also a growing rural population that faced harsh landlords backed by the authority of the cantons themselves. Urban landholders and powerful family heads in the rural cantons used their wealth and connections to pressure the poorer peasantry as land became scarce. The resulting <a id="page_58" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>social tensions were exacerbated by the flow of pensions and bribes from powers outside Switzerland, which mostly ended up in the pockets of political insiders. Swiss success on the Europe an stage thus accelerated the emergence of sharp social differences inside the cantons.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The men in charge of politics, who increasingly adopted an aristocratic way of life, seemed a far cry from the ‘noble peasants’ of the liberation narrative that was beginning to circulate. In 1469–71, for example, the city of Berne was torn by social tensions between the urban guilds and the aristocratic council members who wanted to keep their feudal jurisdictions free from the city’s control. The struggle broke out after a commoner was elected mayor, and was triggered by a decree that forbade citizens to wear aristocratic clothing. The authorities in the rural cantons often lacked the means to quell outbreaks of popular dissatisfaction, while Berne, Zurich and Lucerne seemed more interested in expanding their ties to additional cities, rather than remaining within the bounds of the Confederacy that had been affirmed at such a high cost during the Old Zurich War . When the three towns sealed a new permanent pact with Solothurn and Fribourg – cities in Berne’s orbit that had been drawing closer to the Confederacy – the rural cantons objected. New members were being slipped into the Confederacy , they claimed, tilting the balance towards the cities. That Fribourg lay on the language border and had a bilingual patriciate was inconsequential in the debates over its admission to the Confederacy; indeed the rural cantons objected to more cities, not to more French-speakers, in the Confederacy. Tensions rose further in 1478 after the council in Obwalden instigated resistance to Lucerne’s administration of the Entlebuch , a rural area lying between the two cantons.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-773"><img src="../images/00015.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">2.4 </span>St Niklaus von Flüe. Military success in the Burgundian Wars (1474–7) only increased social and political tensions within the Confederacy. A stalemate over admitting new urban members and controlling the free-lance militias from rural regions threatened the Confederacy’s survival in 1480. The intervention of the hermit (and former high magistrate) Niklaus von Flüe of Obwalden brought about the <span class="italic">Stanser Verkommnis</span>, which reaffirmed the magistrates’ authority in both cities and rural cantons. Niklaus was canonized in 1947 as the patron saint of Switzerland.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Assisted by the mediation of the hermit Niklaus von Flüe of Obwalden, a compromise, the <span class="italic">Stanser Verkommnis</span> , emerged in 1481 to resolve both urban and rural cantons’ complaints. On the one hand, Solothurn and Fribourg joined the Confederacy through treaties with the existing VIII cantons, while a new statute forbade unauthorized assemblies, and bound all the cantons to help suppress unrest. This measure strengthened the territorial integrity of all the cantons and the authority of each canton’s existing regime. On the other hand, the primacy of the first VIII cantons was acknowledged, and Solothurn and Fribourg had to accept a second-tier membership that substantially <a id="page_59" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> restricted their freedom of action. The settlement of 1481 thus represented another modest step toward political and territorial coherence for the Confederacy , and away from the freewheeling flexibility of the earlier alliances. It also reinforced the authority of cantonal magistrates over their citizens and subjects, and contributed another element to Swiss mythology, the selfless hermit Niklaus (who was beatified in 1648 and declared a saint in 1947).</p>
<p class="calibre4">That this agreement had not resolved rising social tensions between peasants, burghers and rising magnates became clear in 1489, when <a id="page_60" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>the powerful mayor of Zurich, Hans Waldmann , ran afoul of Zurich’s citizens and rural subjects. By this time, the city had consolidated its hold over a broad territory whose inhabitants enjoyed limited local self-government while answering to city-appointed bailiffs for taxes, justice and military service. City administration imposed substantial burdens on its subjects. When Zurich purchased Winterthur in 1467, for example, the costs were covered by a head-tax and property tax on all inhabitants of city and country, with every taxpayer carefully recorded and assessed. Waldmann came from a relatively modest background but rose quickly to prominence in Zurich during the 1460s and 1470s. Like many strongmen in this period, military experience and marriage to a rich widow enabled his rise. He served as a captain of Zurich’s troops at Murten in 1476 and as a mercenary in Germany, bringing him wealth and prestige that he deployed to gain further influence inside Zurich. His stature as leader of one of the two most influential cantons, in turn, made him vital to Swiss negotiations with outside powers, which brought him direct pensions from the King of France and Maximilian of Habsburg , heir to the imperial throne. By 1485, his dominance of Zurich politics seemed complete. He advanced Zurich’s interests in peace with the Habsburgs and mercenary service for Milan , while also intensifying the city’s administration over its own rural subjects.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The emergence of strongmen with near-dictatorial powers was common in the urban states of fifteenth-century Europe. Just as regularly, such rulers faced factional rivals eager to replace them and popular unrest from citizens who resented the hollowing out of republican constitutions . Waldmann, however, faced an additional source of unrest that sealed his fate: well-organized rural communities. When the city began cracking down on rural textile manufacturing and ordered all rural families to kill their dogs (the better to allow aspiring urban elites to enjoy hunting, the peasants believed), rural unrest combined with citizen dissatisfaction to trigger a rebellion. Several factors made such uprisings particularly common across Switzerland. First, Swiss rural communities enjoyed greater autonomy and stronger corporate organization than those in most European regions, and many peasants had military experience. Additionally, the Swiss ideology of ‘noble peasants resisting tyrannical aristocrats ’ could easily be turned against ambitious men like Waldmann. Finally, peasant <a id="page_61" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>subjects in Switzerland had only to look to their neighbours in Schwyz , Uri, and Unterwalden to see emancipated peasants who enjoyed substantial political rights. In April 1489, Zurich’s peasant subjects marched against the city, where they joined dissatisfied citizens. In accord with the <span class="italic">Stanser Verkommnis</span> , the other cantons sent representatives to mediate, but the murder of a Waldmann henchman during the negotiations led to the collapse of his power; he was tortured, tried and publicly executed a few days later. A wave of further executions took place as various factions settled scores, while a large cash payment to the peasantry , together with repeal of Waldmann ’s new laws, convinced them to march home. No Swiss canton could ignore its rural population, despite the rise of urban and rural oligarchies.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Swiss consolidation at the end of the century ran in parallel with similar developments in the Empire of which Switzerland remained a part. Lawlessness, noble feuds and weak central government still flourished in the late 1400s. With the accession of a new Emperor, Maximilian, in 1493, widespread interest in an imperial public peace and new institutions to provide justice and order led (after much wrangling) to major reforms in 1495. The Confederacy did not participate in negotiating the reforms, however – which included new imperial courts and a universal tax – and insisted that their existing privileges superseded the new measures. The resulting political tensions were exacerbated by visible social and cultural rivalry: the southern German city of Constance , closely tied to the Thurgau and the Swiss but also a participant in German developments, often provided a flashpoint for rowdy clashes at markets and festivals. Meanwhile, the beginning of the Italian Wars, set off by the French invasion of Naples in 1494, increased the strategic value of both Swiss passes and Swiss mercenaries to the Empire, giving the Confederacy greater political leverage.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-808"><img src="../images/00016.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">2.5 </span>Battle of Calven, 1499. An early chronicle of the Swabian War used this generic image, with Christ watching the fighters, to illustrate the skirmish at the Calven, at the south-eastern margin of the III Leagues of the Grisons. A surprise attack from the rear by Grisons forces drove a Habsburg expeditionary force into retreat. The Battle of Calven became an iconic event for the Republic of the III Leagues, in parallel with Sempach’s role for the Confederacy, with its own exemplary hero in the person of Benedikt Fontana.</div>
<p class="calibre4">The multiple tensions between the Confederacy and the Empire provoked a last war between the House of Habsburg and the Swiss in 1499. A relatively minor border dispute between the Bishop of Chur , backed by the League of the House of God in the Grisons , and Habsburg administrators in the Tyrol set off the conflict. The Leagues had signed treaties for military cooperation with the Confederacy in 1497 and 1498, while Maximilian called on the Swabian League and on imperial forces to show the ‘peasants ’ their place. Although <a id="page_62" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Berne and Zurich sought to mediate, local skirmishes quickly accelerated into an open war along a front reaching from Basle to the Grisons. Much of the action revolved around raiding and looting (Grisons and Tyrolean mountaineers, in particular, seemed more <a id="page_63" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>interested in seizing their neighbours’ cattle than in the legal issues that occupied the urban governments), but Swiss forces consistently prevailed in various largely impromptu battles, despite Maximilian’s personal engagement. As the Habsburgs’ military situation deteriorated, Maximilian declared imperial war on the Swiss and turned to propaganda, issuing a manifesto that evoked Leopold III, killed in 1386 ‘on his own, by his own, on account of his own’, and characterized the Swiss as ‘bad, coarse and disrespectful peasants’. General exhaustion, along with French advances in northern Italy , led to a truce and then a settlement favourable to the Swiss. At Swiss insistence, the Peace of Basle (22 September 1499) treated the conflict as a private feud between the Habsburgs and the Bishop of Chur and his subjects, not as a formally declared war. The imperial reform was not mentioned specifically, but the final clauses of the treaty blandly negated all suits regarding the Confederates, which provided <span class="italic">de facto</span> exemption from the new institutions. Although later historians spoke of Swiss independence after 1499, the Swiss negotiators were in fact intent on restoring their good standing in the Holy Roman Empire . In contemporary terms, the peace gave the Swiss Confederacy a status similar to the most important imperial princes – not least the Habsburgs themselves as Archdukes of Austria – by providing them with exemption from imperial courts and with the freedom to make alliances and wage war without imperial intervention.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-825"><span class="title">The Swiss as a European Factor, 1499–1520</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The history of Swiss military triumphs and increasingly aggressive foreign adventures peaked between 1490 and 1515, followed by a rapid withdrawal. The potency of the Swiss infantry had become frighteningly visible during the Burgundian war , and was confirmed in Italy after 1494 and in 1499. Involvement in northern Italy – part of a struggle for the Italian peninsula pitting Valois France against Habsburgs in Spain and Austria – dominated political life in the Confederacy  from 1500 to 1520. Swiss mercenary companies became a hot commodity, and money flowed freely, both publicly and in private, to the cantons and their leaders. Huge numbers of Swiss men streamed south, pushed by the increasing scarcity of available land at home and pulled by generous pay and the promise of loot. <a id="page_64" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Several cantons and allies seized the opportunity to expand their own control further south into the Italian Alpine foothills, bringing the Valtellina and Ticino under Swiss control. Military successes by Swiss troops even raised the possibility that Milan – far larger and richer than any Swiss city – might become a tributary of the Confederacy. The conditions favouring the Swiss forces turned out to be temporary, however. Changing military tactics undermined the superiority of the Swiss infantry as decisively as the Swiss had undermined heavy noble cavalry. When the Habsburg, Valois and Trastámara dynasties emerged from their fifteenth-century weakness, moreover, they controlled funds and forces far beyond those available to the Confederacy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Swiss participation in the Italian Wars moved large numbers of men to Italy’s battlefields – where many died – and large amounts of money to the treasuries of the cantons and to military entrepreneurs. It also constituted the most important shared business among the cantons during the first two decades of the sixteenth century. Negotiations with foreign envoys and among the Diet’s delegates over the best strategy to follow were frequent and often divisive. In addition to the existing tensions between the cities and the rural cantons and old divides such as the rivalry between Schwyz and Zurich came new divisions: Berne and Fribourg wanted support for expansion toward Vaud ; the Inner Swiss , the Valais and Grisons wanted support for acquisitions in Italy ; and Zurich and Schaffhausen sought peace with the Confederacy’s neighbours, not least because they were trade and manufacturing centres.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Diet provided a site for discussions of such problems, but negotiation also took place before the councils of individual cantons, or in secret with leading political figures. By 1500, the leaders of most cantons felt that they had lost control over military recruiting . This threatened the magistrates’ monopoly over the means of violence within their own territories, and also meant that lucrative pensions and bribes might elude their grasp. Popular hostility to recruiting resulted from the many deaths in Italy , and from anger at the luxurious life of the military entrepreneurs. Magisterial and popular concerns came together in attacks on mercenaries and their recruiters. In 1503, these concerns motivated a new Confederate statute, the <span class="italic">Pension enbrief</span>, which prohibited private military <a id="page_65" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_66" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>recruiting and required a majority of the Diet to approve troop agreements. It soon became clear that the cantons could not carry out their own decision, however, since new agreements with foreign recruiters continued.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-854"><img src="../images/00017.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">2.6 </span>Song of the Battle of Novara outside Milan, 1513. The Swiss celebrated their repeated battlefield victories in Italy before 1515 through the new medium of print. The song here, which celebrated God’s and the Virgin Mary’s support of Swiss troops, carried the coats of arms of the XIII Confederates and their allies, along with the image of the Virgin with child that Pope Julius had awarded the Swiss for their military banners in 1512.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Two major military decisions near Milan – an avoided battle and a lost one – illustrate the limits to Swiss participation on the European stage. At Novara in 1500, a French army consisting largely of Swiss mercenaries surrounded another Swiss force guarding Duke Ludovico Sforza of Milan, who sought to recapture his duchy from the French. The possibility that Swiss might fight Swiss on behalf of foreign princes led to negotiations that allowed the force employed by Sforza to withdraw. Sforza disguised himself among the Swiss to escape, but was betrayed by a soldier from Uri. Mercenary service, especially when not controlled by the Diet , had nearly caused a fratricidal disaster, and had brought dishonour for the Swiss. After another decade of battlefield victories, the Battle of Marignano in 1515 revealed the end of Swiss invincibility. The battle began after many of the Swiss regiments present had accepted 1 million French crowns to yield Milan to the new French king, François I. Other regiments decided to fight, however, and drew their compatriots back into the battle. The artillery that François deployed proved devastatingly effective against the massed Swiss infantry. Nearly half the Swiss on the field of Marignano lost their lives, provoking bitter debates about who was responsible for so many deaths. Never again did Swiss forces command European battlefields: weak central command and new military technologies made them unable to compete with the armies of the early modern period.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Swiss manpower remained interesting to the great powers, however, especially to France. Rather than suffering a collapse of its diplomatic interests after 1515, therefore, the Confederacy negotiated a lasting and profitable alignment with one power, France. Even after major losses, thousands of Swiss soldiers could be raised at very short notice. Only a year after the catastrophe at Marignano, for example, the French and the Habsburgs recruited nearly 25,000 troops from the Confederacy. Swiss men thus continued to perform military service outside Switzerland, mostly under a very favourable 1521 mercenary treaty with France that included all the cantons (except Zurich) along with the Grisons  and Valais . The Swiss already received large <a id="page_67" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>reparations in 1516, and increased annual pensions went to every signing canton in 1521. Among other provisions, special tariff and toll privileges in Milan and France and privileged access to French salt markets had long-lasting consequences. In exchange, the French king gained the right to recruit up to 16,000 infantrymen for his campaigns. The Habsburgs and the Swiss also negotiated a permanent peace in 1511, the <span class="italic">Erbeinung</span> . By 1521, the Swiss had thus stabilized their relations with the two most powerful neighbouring rulers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The structure of the Confederacy around 1500 – as a coherent network of allies that acted in concert – meant that new members remained a possibility. Notably, the successes of Swiss arms in Burgundy , Italy and Swabia encouraged the formation of pro-Swiss factions in many nearby cities. After the Swabian war, such a faction in Basle led the city away from its Alsatian allies and into the Confederacy in 1501. Schaffhausen , too, seized the moment to move from being an ally to a member of the Confederacy , even if its membership limited its ability to pursue independent policies. Mühlhausen, already allied with Solothurn, Berne and Basle, followed in 1515, accepting the status of an associate (<span class="italic">Zugewandter</span>) to strengthen its position as the Habsburgs consolidated their hold on the rest of Alsace .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Once Habsburg and the Valois controlled Alsace, Burgundy, Milan, Tyrol and Swabia, however, opportunities for adding either members or new subject territories diminished. Only the lands of the House of Savoy still offered opportunity, which culminated with Bernese seizure of the Vaud in 1536. Tellingly, the last full member to join the Confederacy, Appenzell , was not on the borders. Rather, its membership in 1513 merely clarified treaties going back to 1452, and reflected the participation of the Appenzeller as partners in Italy. Despite the objections of the Abbots and city of St Gallen  , who remained mere associates, the Appenzellers joined under terms similar to those for Schaffhausen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Encouraged by difficult economic circumstances and anger at ‘corrupt’ magistrates and arrogant mercenary entrepreneurs, popular unrest boiled over repeatedly in southern Germany and in the Confederacy in the early 1500s. Both regions were affected by military losses, and both experienced rising social conflicts over dues, rents and noble jurisdiction. Peasant unrest in Swabia took the form of conspiracies energetically suppressed by nobles and <a id="page_68" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>ruling cities, whereas rural subjects in Switzerland were more successful in gaining remedies. When the authorities ignored rural discontent after 1510, numerous Swiss peasant communes took action. Unhappy subjects of Berne stormed the city in 1513 after gathering at a church festival in Köniz, and demanded that alliances with foreign princes be subject to their approval. Similarly, Zurich ’s rural subjects marched into the city in late 1515, convinced that the Swiss defeat at Marignano had been brought about by French bribes . In both cases, the magistrates were forced to acknowledge their subjects’ right to participate in decisions on war and peace, slowing the growing trend towards oligarchy that Switzerland shared with its neighbours.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-895"><span class="title">A European Nation and Culture</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Events in the second half of the fifteenth century resulted in the emergence of a Swiss polity and Swiss nation , the Old Confederacy, which survived with few formal changes from 1513 to 1798. Military success in the early 1500s gave the Confederacy political weight, while Swiss participation in European culture and the emergence of a distinctive Swiss histori cal mythology helped form an identity, internally and externally, that set the Swiss apart from their neighbours and that increasingly shaped their choices and actions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The key cultural development of fifteenth-century Europe was the intellectual movement we call the Renaissance . Beginning in Italy , Renaissance educational and historical thinking spread across the Continent, leaving traces in the Swiss region as well. Notably, Switzerland became a distinct region in the minds of Europeans owing to the efforts of Humanist geographers who reintroduced the old Roman designations Helvetia and Raetia to the region. The two Church councils held in the region – at Constance from 1414 to 1418 and in Basle from 1431 to 1449 – also increased Europeans’ familiarity with Switzerland, while the growing prominence of Swiss mercenaries in various European wars led to a rather different picture, emphasizing the barbarity and effectiveness of Switzerland’s soldiers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Renaissance Humanism began to influence Swiss intellectuals late in the fifteenth century. Local writers mixed Humanist-style historiography and geography with more traditional forms of chronicle in <a id="page_69" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_70" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> describing the Confederacy. Early on, Albrecht von Bonstetten praised the Confederacy in his <span class="italic">Superioris Germaniae Confoederationis Descriptio</span> of 1479, while later Swiss Humanists wrote in more refined Latin, notably the two Glarus scholars Heinrich Loriti (‘Glareanus ’, 1484–1563) and Aegidius Tschudi, (1505–72). Tschudi compiled Classical references to the ancient Roman province of Raetia in his only published work, though he was equally interested in medieval charters, which he zealously copied in manuscript. Like many Swiss Humanists, Glareanus spent considerable time in Basle, the site of the first (and for a long time the only) Swiss university, founded in 1460. The confluence of Basle’s printing industry and its university ensured that Basle became the only Swiss city where Humanism really flourished, illustrated most vividly by Erasmus of Rotterdam’s decision to live there.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-908"><img src="../images/00018.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">2.7 </span>William Tell shooting the apple. The story of William Tell’s deeds emerged after 1470 to become a central point of reference for Swiss identity. In the first printed chronicle of Swiss history by Petermann Etterlin, Tell was depicted with the ‘three confederates’ of the earlier chronicles, about to loose his quarrel at his son. As in most versions, a second quarrel was ready in his hood, intended for the evil bailiff Gessler should Tell’s son be harmed.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Renaissance thinking had little influence on the enduring cycle of myths and stories that explained the origins, legitimacy and virtues of the Swiss Confederacy, first to the Swiss and then to the rest of Europe. As a confederation of republics in a monarchical world, and as a polity based on corporate citizenship rather than feudal hierarchy, Switzerland was unusual in early modern Europe. The Swiss liberation saga wove the tale of the brave crossbowman William Tell together with that of the three virtuous ‘oath comrades’ (<span class="italic">drei Eidgenossen</span>) from Uri , Schwyz and Unterwalden , uniting anti-aristocratic themes, stories of brave sacrifice against tyrannical abuses and a running emphasis on God’s support of the virtuous Swiss. The oldest surviving version of the Tell story – with most of its elements already in place – dates to 1470, when it was copied into a book of charters, the White Book of Saarnen , compiled in Obwalden. It described how after the death of the good king Rudolf in 1291, greedy bailiffs from the Thurgau and Aargau oppressed the inhabitants of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden by seizing their animals, abusing their wives and daughters, and threatening their sons. In response, the men of the valleys formed a secret conspiracy to protect their traditional liberty. Before they could act, the Uri bailiff Gessler placed his hat on a stake, demanding that every man bow to it as though he himself were present. The wild hunter Tell refused, and when he mocked Gessler after his arrest, was ordered to shoot an apple from his son’s head. Gessler then <a id="page_71" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>reneged on his promise to leave Tell unharmed, but Tell escaped, and after lying in wait, killed Gessler with another arrow, triggering a general rebellion by the Confederates.</p>
<p class="calibre4">These stories, with added elements celebrating the battles at Morgarten and Sempach and the subsequent growth of the Confederacy, soon found their way into numerous songs and chronicles, and were available in print after 1507 in Petermann Etterlin ’s <span class="italic">Kronica von der loblichen Eydtgnoschaft</span> (Chronicle of the Praiseworthy Confederacy). Altogether, the medieval genre of the chronicle flourished to an extraordinary degree in Switzerland, especially after 1450, with elaborate illustrated chronicles sponsored by city councils recording the history – usually in very self-interested ways – of the cantons and their alliances. The myth of resistance against tyrannical nobles helped explain the autonomy of the Swiss, who were represented as enjoying liberties going back to Roman times that evil nobles sought to usurp. It also provided a counterpoint to the critical literature circulating after the 1440s that dismissed the Swiss as crude rebellious peasants, which appeared in everything from diplomatic correspondence to formal manifestos. Notably – and with considerable consequences for Swiss political culture – the debate over the legitimacy of the Confederacy tended to cast all of the Swiss as ‘peasants’, no matter their actual status or wealth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Swiss engagement in Italy after 1494 also attracted attention from European thinkers, most notably Niccolò Machiavelli , who admired the Swiss combination of military effectiveness and republican government. In <span class="italic">The Prince</span>, he praised the Swiss with his observation that ‘Rome and Sparta remained armed and free for many centuries; the Swiss are most armed, and thus most free.’ In contrast to literary Humanism , the artistic impulses of the Renaissance found only a piecemeal reception in Switzerland. The most lasting influence occurred in the Italian valleys south of the Alps , where village churches and local palaces were decorated in popular versions of the Renaissance style. Elsewhere, the Late Gothic style of the north continued to predominate, although significant visual artists like Hans Holbein the Younger – also from Basle – and Urs Graf adopted Renaissance techniques in their work.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Confederacy of the early 1500s possessed both a political system and a cultural and political identity that put it on a par with <a id="page_72" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>other princely states within the Holy Roman Empire . Despite growing social tensions, it enjoyed relative peace and internal stability, while its scholars proclaimed its virtues to the world.
