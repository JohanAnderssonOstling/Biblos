<p class="noindent">Modern historians concur that ‘the Swiss’ and ‘Switzerland’ are concepts that emerged only in the 1400s, and that a modern state of Switzerland emerged only in the early nineteenth century, taking its final shape in 1848. Geographical and historical conditions of the region in and north of the central Alps after the year 1000, however, did provide the conditions in which a Swiss people and a Swiss political system could emerge, and shaped those people and that system in important ways. A pivotal feature of the physical and human geography described in this chapter is complexity and diversity. Neither the landscape, nor the societies, nor the institutions found in this region around the year 1000 provided any notable unity for its inhabitants. Rather, a Swiss identity emerged only through historical evolution, and remains to the present characterized by an internal variety in language, religion and culture that distinguishes Switzerland from most other European nation-states. Broad historical trends stretching back to the central Middle Ages allowed for political innovation and flexibility within the framework of noble rule in the region by 1250; this flexibility opened opportunities for various actors between 1250 and 1386 to produce a loose but stable network of alliances among cities, towns and mountain valleys – the early Swiss <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718"><span class="italic">Eidgenossenschaft</span></a></span> , or Confederacy. The loose Confederacy of around 1386 was the immediate precursor of the Old Confederacy (<span class="italic">Alte Eidgenossenschaft</span>) that took shape between 1386 and 1513, and thereafter remained largely stable until 1798.</p>

<p class="noindent"> Modern Switzerland occupies 41,285 square kilometres, which makes it one of the smaller European states. More than half of this space is occupied by the Alps and their northern outliers, the pre-Alps ; another 1,740 square kilometres are occupied by water, including two major lakes located on current national boundaries, Lake Geneva and Lake Constance . The Swiss Alps include most of the highest mountains in Europe, although the highest peak, Mont Blanc, lies in France near the Swiss border. The Alps have long been settled, and Alpine passes have since Roman times connected the Italian peninsula to France and Germany. Deep valleys reach between the pre-Alps and far into the Alps themselves from both north and south, providing arable land and access to passes; agrarian settlements also spread higher up the slopes – as high as 2000 m during the High Middle Ages (<span><img height="1em" src="../images/00002.gif" alt="U+223C" class="calibre8"/></span>1000 – <span><img height="1em" src="../images/00002.gif" alt="U+223C" class="calibre8"/></span>1300). The pre-Alpine spurs extending north from the major ranges consist of steep hill country and lower peaks, as does the Jura range which runs in an arc along Switzerland’s north-western border. Between the Alps and Jura lie the Swiss midlands , with relatively level although by no means flat terrain, which have formed the centre of both agriculture and population throughout the last millennium. All of Switzerland’s major cities, from Geneva to St Gallen , are located in the midlands, though several, notably Lucerne, are nestled among pre-Alpine ranges. Modern Switzerland does not extend beyond the southern edge of the Alps, which subside abruptly into the North Italian plain. At the peak of the pre-modern Confederacy’s power, efforts to incorporate the south slope of the Alps and even the city of Milan on the north Italian plain took place, but ultimately the Swiss were pushed back to the mouths of the deep valleys that cut into the mountains.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Two major European rivers, the Rhône and the Rhine , have their springs in modern Switzerland, along with the Inn, tributary to the Danube , and several northern tributaries to the Po. The upper river valleys provided pathways towards a series of mountain passes , control over which always represented an economic and political prize. The lowest Alpine pass, the Brenner (1370 m), lies in modern Austria , too far east for travellers between Italy and the northern Continent, <a id="page_13" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>whereas the Swiss passes offer shorter routes, though at altitudes over 2000 m. The Alpine routes across Switzerland fall into three major groups. To the west, the upper Rhône leads to the Great St Bernard and the Simplon passes, and south to Turin and Milan. In the east, various routes – the Julier, the Septimer, the Splügen, the San Bernardino – connect the upper Rhine to Como and Milan. The third route through central Switzerland, the St Gotthard, only opened for international trade around 1200, and connects Basle to Milan via major Swiss tributaries to the Rhine. In addition to its directness, the St Gotthard offered the advantage of lake transport from Lucerne far into the Alps at Fluelen in Uri and then from the Maggadino plain far south toward Milan . Its opening triggered economic growth and broader horizons in the formerly isolated valleys, as became evident in their precocious emergence as privileged corporate communities headed by local noble clans in the 1200s. Along each mountain route, local communities maintained paths, provided draft animals and in the winter sleds, and charged travellers and merchants to pass by, as well as using the passes to connect with their own immediate neighbours. Since the times of Hannibal, armies have also crossed the Alps . In the Middle Ages, it was above all German Emperors who brought troops south through the mountains on the way to their coronations in Rome, or to assert their imperial rights in Italy as successors to the Emperors of classical Rome.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-205"><img src="../images/00003.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">Map 1.1 </span>Switzerland: physical</div>
<p class="calibre4">Switzerland’s striking landscape shaped patterns of human settlement and of economic exploitation of the environment. The midlands have always been the core zone for population and agriculture , providing the staple grains essential for all pre-modern economies. Since their hilly terrain is well watered and generally well drained, the midlands are fertile, though not suitable for the high-intensity cultivation that developed on Europe’s wider plains. Subsistence agriculture extended far – and high – into the Alpine massif as well, but commercial growth during the High Middle Ages encouraged more and more Alpine dwellers to adopt herding as a primary occupation. With suitable investment in paths and irrigation ditches, the summer riches of the high meadows – the actual ‘alps’ – allowed the production of meat, fats and cheese, high-value products for export that could pay for imported grains. The region’s fractured landscape ensured that both midlands and pre-Alps remained modestly <a id="page_14" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_15" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>populated; the cities and towns that sprung up along the Swiss lakes and rivers were correspondingly small in European comparison, though numerous. Several of the oldest and most significant lay at key points on the region’s most important lakes and rivers, including Basle, Chur, Geneva , Lucerne and Zurich  . </p>
<p class="calibre4">In the Middle Ages, trade was the second major occupation of the region’s people, after agriculture. In addition to local trade that expanded with population growth and economic expansion, the confluence of several major trans-European routes ensured a steady stream of long-distance trade. In addition to the crucial north–south routes across the Alps to Italy , east–west trade on an axis that reached as far as Nuremberg and Poland to the north-east and Genoa and Barcelona to the south-west crossed the Swiss midlands north of the Alpine massif. Local producers of silk, wool and linen textiles became contributors to and beneficiaries of this route, which in the Middle Ages centred on entrepôts at Geneva and later Lyons; later, such routes also took Swiss emigrant craftsmen far into north-central Europe as well. Cities including Fribourg, Berne and St Gallen thrived at various times owing to this trade . Mining, in contrast, never flourished, because the central Alps are unusually bereft of significant mineral deposits.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the pre-modern period, human and animal muscles provided energy for almost all undertakings, along with water power that turned mills and drove fish into weirs. During the early Industrial Revolution, water power provided Swiss factories with an enviable advantage, and it remains important to the present in the form of hydroelectric generation. Wood, another universal energy source in pre-modern Europe, was abundant in most of Switzerland, being used to heat forges as well as houses and baths. Even before the modern period, deforestation became a major problem far into the mountains, since the rivers made rafting logs downstream to Swabia and Austria relatively easy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As all of Europe thrived in the High Middle Ages, the Swiss region saw steady expansion of population and of cultivated land. By the end of the thirteenth century, the population may have reached 800,000 (although records are too sparse for accurate measurements). A notable feature of this period was the expansion of existing cities and the founding of many more. In medieval society, cities enjoyed a particular legal status that included a group of citizens <a id="page_16" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>who were personally free, rather than serfs, along with the privilege to hold markets and conduct business under favourable terms. The older Swiss cities had bishops (Basle , Chur , Geneva , Lausanne , Sion) , or cloisters (Lucerne, Zurich) as their nominal lords, while most of the newer cities (e.g. Berne, Fribourg , Schaffhausen ) resulted from lordly foundations intended to demonstrate prestige, secure roads, encourage trade and increase population. In periods of political fragmentation, even minor lords founded cities, often minuscule; this explains the region’s unusual density of cities, which also resulted in a surprisingly urbanized population by 1200.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The attractive environment of the Swiss midlands drew diverse settlers from pre-history onwards including Celts, Romans and Germanic migrants such as the Franks, Burgundians and Alemanni. During the central Middle Ages, Germanic languages even spread south of the Alps with the Goths and Lombards, but by the year 1000, the rough distribution of German as well as three post-Roman languages (French, Italian and Rhaeto-Romance) in the region was well established. Never in the pre-modern period did political boundaries follow linguistic divides, however, and shifts in the boundaries between languages continued well into the fifteenth century. The Alps generally separated Italian from French, with Rhaeto-Romance increasingly restricted to higher valleys in the eastern Alps. Of the various Germanic invaders, the Alemanni had the most influence on the German spoken in modern Switzerland, which shares many features with that of south-west Germany. In the history of the Swiss Confederacy after 1300, German was the primary language, although the Confederacy gained Romance-speaking allies and subjects; only in Fribourg did French and German coexist in politics and administration from the fourteenth century onwards. </p>
<p class="calibre4">Christianity spread into the Swiss region during the Roman period, with evidence for bishoprics at centres from Geneva to Chur by the mid-400s. The Germanic invaders arriving in the fifth and sixth centuries were initially pagan, but by 700, the christianization of the region was largely complete. Multiple ethnic communities and political fragmentation ensured a complex ecclesiastical terrain as well. Seven separate bishoprics held authority in the region (Basle, Chur, Como , Constance, Geneva , Lausanne and Sion/Sitten), mostly with considerable territory outside the future Switzerland. <a id="page_17" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>These sees in turn belonged to no fewer than five archbishoprics (Besançon, Mainz, Milan , Tarentaise and the patriarchate of Aquileia), and were punctuated by numerous autonomous abbeys and cloisters. Most of the German-speaking areas adhered to the newly founded Bishopric of Constance after 600. Founded to evangelize the Alemanni, this enormous diocese spread far to the north, which led to growing disjunctions when the Swiss began to separate from their Swabian neighbours. None of this prevented a lively spiritual life and visible support for local churches from emerging, but it did enable divergent responses to conflicts involving the church, such as the Investiture Controversy, the schisms of the fourteenth century and the Reformation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Politically, all of modern Switzerland once belonged to the Roman Empire, unlike regions further north and east. The territory was divided among several Roman provinces, but these left few traces; after the collapse of Rome, various Germanic kingdoms claimed shifting slices of the region with equally ephemeral results. The brief reunification of Western Europe under the Franks around 800 brought all of Switzerland under a single ruler again, but beginning with the Treaty of Verdun in 843, successor kingdoms again claimed various parts of the central Alps and the midlands. By the 1030s, both major regional powers, the Kingdom of Burgundy in the west and the Duchy of Swabia in the north, belonged to the German Empire – and both were beginning to fragment, leaving local aristocrats as the main political forces. In the south, German claims to Lombardy steadily lost significance as first feudal dynasties, and then the Itali an cities – especially Milan – became autonomous.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Along with the decaying kingdoms and duchies and the regional noble dynasties, the High Middle Ages brought new political actors onto the scene: these included urban communities, ecclesiastical foundations and eventually rural communities as well. The key legal and cultural change that enabled this development was the emergence of the political corporation as a legitimate political actor. Starting with monasteries and cathedral chapters, ‘bodies’ of members (Latin: <span class="italic">corpora</span>) gained the ability to possess property and privileges, and to exercise lordship . This development allowed all sorts of corporate entities to operate within the lordship-based political culture of medieval Europe. Initially, many towns and cities enjoyed support and <a id="page_18" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>sponsorship of expanded privileges from their lords (feudal or ecclesiastical), since a thriving town enhanced its lord’s resources and prestige. After 1100, however, urban interests increasingly diverged from those of the nobility: urban elites valued peaceful trade and manufactures, whereas the fragmentation of political authority across Europe generated growing feudal violence amongst the aristocracy. The privileges and personal freedom to be found in cities, moreover, provided an environment in which organized resistance to lords’ authority was not only possible, but often successful. Especially in the band of territory from central Italy to the Netherlands , including the future Swiss regions and the western parts of Germany , cities succeeded in becoming autonomous political actors, often bolstered by royal or imperial privileges that could be gained through political support – or bought for hard cash – from often beleaguered rulers. Similar privileges could be obtained from bishops, abbeys, and other lords as well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Within the Empire, the status of ‘imperial liberty’ (<span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3735"><span class="italic">Reichsfreiheit</span></a></span>) represented the greatest autonomy: imperial free cities (and other imperially privileged entities, including abbeys and rural communes ) were ‘subject to the Emperor alone’, and often possessed imperial privileges to appoint their own imperial bailiff and to operate courts with no right of appeal. Within the imperial cities, political authority lay in the hands of a limited number of full citizens, usually local knights and merchants, who formed the corporation that embodied the city’s privileges. As internal autonomy increased, other social groups sought to join the politically active citizenship. The most important were craftsmen organized into guilds , which regulated and limited production and trade in specific goods. Guilds usually pursued both charitable and political goals as well as regulating their crafts, and led other social groups in seeking the formation of larger political councils on which they could be represented, or outright guild regimes in which only guild members played a part. By the fourteenth century, a wide range of internal arrangements characterized the cities that joined the Swiss Confederacy . While by no means democratic by modern standards, they offered more inhabitants a chance to participate in political life than under aristocratic dominion, and encouraged a culture that rejected aristocratic values and celebrated the ‘common man’ (if not the common woman ).</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-269"><img src="../images/00004.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">1.1 </span>Urban Guilds. In this sixteenth-century representation from Basle, a guild’s leadership enjoys a sumptuous banquet while ostentatiously displaying their (notably plebeian) coats-of-arms and matching outfits. Guilds in the High Middle Ages led opposition to merchant oligarchies in the towns, but, like other Swiss institutions, became bastions of family privilege and solidarity after about 1500.</div>
<a id="page_19" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Urban autonomy was common across medieval Europe, and many rural communities adopted corporate forms of organization in the High Middle Ages, but rural communities with imperial liberty emerged in only a few areas, notably in the central Alps . Valley communities in the mountains from the Valais to the Grisons organized as political corporations bearing seals and administering justice, and once they had gained sufficient legal privileges and autonomy, joined as equal members the networks of alliances among communes that characterized the entire region. Several factors enabled this development: location on the passes critical to imperial policy in Italy , the <a id="page_20" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>relative weakness of the major feudal dynasties and the high degree of cooperation demanded by pastoralism in the Alps, which encouraged strong collective institutions. Living in a diverse landscape of nobles, towns and cities also provided models and sometimes the impetus to organize on corporate lines. Histo rians have pointed to the emergence of alliances that included both urban and rural communes as a distinctive feature that enabled the Swiss leagues to thrive and survive after 1500, even as primarily urban alliances elsewhere foundered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As the importance of imperial privileges illustrates, the ideal of universal Christian monarchy in the form of a ‘Roman’ Empire remained powerful in medieval Europe. By 1000, this Empire was a largely Germanic institution, including all of modern Switzerland and with claims in Italy, though the name Roman Empire or later Holy Roman Empire remained. As it took shape, the Swiss Confederacy never challenged the principle of its subjection to imperial authority, and Switzerland remained formally part of the Empire until its dissolution in 1806, even though its jurisdictional autonomy was recognized by the Treaty of Basle in 1499, and its total exemption from imperial authority by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Indeed, from the thirteenth to sixteenth century, the members of the Confederacy eagerly sought and proudly proclaimed their imperial liberties and loyalties, because imperial authority bolstered their hard-won political autonomy against local lords. The situation in these lands was rendered more complex, however, when one powerful regional family, the Habsburgs , joined the small number of dynasties contesting the imperial throne after 1273. When they united their local power with imperial authority, the Habsburg Emperors were well placed to consolidate their power over their family’s territories, including those in Switzerland. At the same time, however, imperial politics and the Habsburgs’ new realms to the east in Austria repeatedly distracted them from their south-west German homeland, allowing political rivals, including the early Swiss Confederacy , to thrive. Crucially, the Habsburgs never gained undisputed imperial authority in the years between 1308 and 1438, despite repeated efforts. By the time Habsburg Emperors sat unchallenged on the throne after 1438, the Swiss Confederacy had not only consolidated, but had also appropriated most Habsburg lordships south of the Rhine.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-288"><img src="../images/00005.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">1.2 </span>Habsburg castle. The Swiss lands are dotted with medieval castles, such as the Habichtsburg, an early seat of the Counts of Habsburg who took their name from the ‘falcon’s castle’ strategically located on the Aar in central Switzerland. Many castles were abandoned as the regional nobility declined after 1300, or were destroyed by communal militias during the region’s political conflicts. This image of the Habsburg from the early seventeenth century shows that the castle avoided this fate, serving instead as the seat of Habsburg servants, then of Bernese administrators after 1415.</div>
<a id="page_21" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">At the peak of the High Middle Ages around 1250, diverse social forms and political organizations flourished in and north of the central Alps . The region shared in trends that characterized all of Western Europe, including growing population and economy, increased commercialization, the rise of autonomous and corporately organized communities and a thriving if heterogeneous <a id="page_22" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Christian religious life organized by a single church. Inhabitants of the region spoke Lombard Italian, Franco-Provençal or Alemannic German, although church affairs still took place in Latin. By the mid-1050s, the region had been incorporated into the German Empire , even as that Empire began to fragment as a system of political dominion; as a result, no single dynasty prevailed. Divided economically, culturally and politically, the region that was to become the Swiss Confederacy had a relatively open political system and society that allowed multiple responses to the crises that lay on the horizon: overpopulation, agrarian breakdown, the Black Death and the continued fragmentation of public order across central Europe. How the important actors in the region responded helps explain the foundations of the political system that emerged fully by the beginning of the sixteenth century: the pre-modern Confederacy of XIII sovereign cantons, along with its diverse subjects, dependants and allies.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-296"><span class="title">Peacekeeping Networks and Political Alliances:</span><span class="subtitle">Forerunners of The Old Confederacy</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The extinction around 1200 of several major regional dynasties in the region north of the Alps set the stage for later developments. The Kings of Burgundy vanished after 1032, and the southern parts of the Duchy of Swabia fell into the hands of the Dukes of Zähringen in 1098. Their family in turn expired in 1218, while the Hohenstaufen dynasty of Emperors and Dukes of Swabia effectively ended in 1250 with the death of Frederick II. The collapse of major dynasties created opportunities for lesser families – in this region, the House of Savoy and the Counts of Habsburg eventually emerged as the new dynasts – but also weakened public order and led to increased local violence and feuding. The imperial interregnum from 1250 to 1273 exacerbated such problems. Papally sponsored anti-Emperors challenged the Hohenstaufen Emperors’ authority until 1257, when the disputed election of two candidates without substantial followings in the German lands accelerated the decay of imperial authority. The failure of existing authorities to maintain order encouraged a solution that appeared across medieval Europe in times of political chaos: the regional peace alliance. </p>
<a id="page_23" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">When Emperors and nobility failed to maintain the peace and protect the roads, other political actors – cities , abbeys and even rural communities – stepped into the breach out of vital self-interest. Such leagues were akin to the Peace of God movement that had earlier emerged in France : the members swore collective oaths to obey the laws, to resist violence and to submit their disputes to arbitration rather than reaching for their weapons, as the feudal nobility was prone to do. Some such alliances included local nobles – particularly weaker families or branches threatened by more powerful rivals – while others were directed against them. Peace alliances reflected the interests of local elites, whether these were petty nobles, urban faction leaders or powerful family heads in rural communities, and frequently shifted as local political constellations changed. To take one example, the city of Berne began seeking allies in the 1240s, reaching out to other cities such as Fribourg (1243) and Solothurn (1295), but also nobles (Savoy, 1256), ecclesiastics (Bishop of Sion , 1252) and rural communes (the Land Valais together with its bishop, 1250). The terms of each alliance reflected the circumstances of the contracting parties, and often described a fixed territory within which the allies agreed to help defend each other against all aggressors, along with provisions for peacefully arbitrating disputes. Since central authority continued to decline through the mid-1200s, multiple overlapping peace alliances (either for a set number of years, or without expiration) became a regular feature of political and legal life in much of Germany . Just north of the Alps , one network of alliances centred on Berne in the west, while further east, Zurich and the other towns participated in ever-changing groupings oriented to the upper Rhine and the Grisons passes , often including cities far into modern Germany.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-320"><img src="../images/00006.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">1.3 </span>The Bundesbrief between Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. Rediscovered only in the eighteenth century, this charter – dated to ‘early August’ of 1291 but most likely drafted in the early 1300s – recorded an alliance among the communities of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden to preserve the peace, administer justice ‘without foreign bailiffs’, and resolve their conflicts through arbitration. Similar in content to many contemporary alliances, this particular document was unusual in recording only rural communities as members. In the nineteenth century, it became an icon that identified the three cantons as founding the Confederacy in 1291.</div>
<p class="calibre4">One particular peace alli ance between the rural mountain valleys of Uri , Schwyz and Nidwalden has come to symbolize the founding of the Swiss Confederacy. Purportedly drafted and sealed in early August 1291, the actual document displays numerous peculiarities, and may well have been written down in 1309 or even later; it nevertheless highlights some unusual features of peace alliances in the central Alps. The document included typical promises of support and adjudication, and the parties vowed to accept no judges from outside the region. The distinguishing element in this alliance is the parties involved: the <span class="italic">homines, universitas</span> or <span class="italic">communitas</span> of Uri, <a id="page_24" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Schwyz and Nidwalden respectively, that is, the political corporations of three rural valleys, who noted they were renewing an earlier alliance. Each of these entities did have a legal and corporate existence by 1291, as shown by the seals each attached to the document and the claims to imperial liberty that each made. Uri , astride the St Gotthard Pass, gained a formal charter of imperial liberty in 1231, although the other two parties’ claims were less secure. Local <a id="page_25" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>aristocrats led the valleys and probably organized the alliance, yet their choice to do so as valley corporations rather than as individuals demonstrates that rural communities in the Alps played an important role in the peace alliance movement by <span class="italic">c</span>. 1300.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-331"><img src="../images/00007.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">1.4 </span>Emperor Rudolf I Habsburg: funerary sculpture. After the violent imperial interregnum of 1251–73, many in the Alpine foothills welcomed the election of Rudolf, leader of the ambitious regional Habsburg dynasty, as Emperor. Rudolf’s award of Austria to his family elevated the Counts of Habsburg to dynastic players of European stature, but subsequently distracted the family from their roots in the German south-west. Fears of renewed strife upon Rudolf’s death in 1291 set off a wave of new local and regional peace alliances, perhaps including the one depicted in illustration 1.3, which is dated to that year.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Several reasons explain the numerous new alliances established in this region right after 1291. First, the imperial interregnum had ended in 1273 with the election of a local noble, Rudolf of Habsburg , to the imperial throne. Local communities, who generally preferred imperial law to the depredations of the regional nobility, on the whole welcomed this development. Rudolf set to work restoring imperial power across Germany , and gained a great victory over Ottokar II Premysl, King of Bohemia, in 1278 that brought his family extensive territories in Austria. This made the Habsburgs one of the most powerful (and longest-lasting) dynasties in European history. In the family’s older territories north of the Alps and in Alsa ce, Rudolf supported regional peace alliances to pacify his new Empire. On his death in 1291, however, a rival dynast, Adolf of Nassau, was elected Emperor, renewing fears of civil war and disorder. The year 1291 was thus a reasonable time to restore or expand local peace alliances: along with their pact with Unterwalden , Uri and Schwyz also signed a three-year peace alliance with Zurich later in the year. On Adolf’s death in 1298, the electors chose Rudolf’s son Albrecht as Emperor. Albrecht’s reign was characterized by constant rebellions across the Empire as he sought to re-establish imperial authority, and ended with Albrecht’s murder by his own nephew in 1308.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Albrecht’s murder and the subsequent instability highlight the political forces active in the region. On the one hand stood networks of peace alliances comprising cities, rural communities, ecclesiastics, and the lesser nobility. These networks were mutable and often evanescent, but their ongoing formation created a set of expectations about maintaining the public peace – by force of arms if needed – that all participants accepted. On the other hand stood an equally complex network of greater and lesser noble families united by marriages and divided by inheritance disputes. Members of each network constantly negotiated with others to create coalitions and to manage crises. Although feuding and wrangling were constant, major wars were rare in this environment. As in Italy , disputes often resulted from the death of dynasts (setting off competition over inheritances) <a id="page_26" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_27" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> or factional disputes within a powerful city (producing angry exiles seeking to overthrow new regimes). The constant negotiations this environment demanded also spurred the rise of politically astute communal leadership capable of seizing opportunities or resisting outside control, thus enabling the emergence of a territorial political system based on alliances rather than on lordship.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Albrecht’s death removed the most powerful force for unity in the Swiss region, while subsequent purges of his noble murderers and their kin further destabilized local power networks. The subsequent elections of non-Habsburg Emperors also gave the Habsburgs’ local rivals in the region powerful outside allies who could offer imperial privileges to weaken their Habsburg competitors. Existing struggles over resources and authority were thus exacerbated, leading to even greater incentives to expand the existing network of peace alliances . It was in this context that a long-standing struggle over grazing rights between the valley of Schwyz and the abbey of Einsiedeln triggered what is traditionally seen as the first major battle of Swiss history at Morgarten on 15 November 1315. A column of troops headed by Duke Leopold of Habsburg, brother of the current Habsburg claimant to the imperial throne, and including contingents from Zurich and other midlands towns, marched towards Schwyz in retaliation for several bold attacks on the abbey, of which the Habsburgs claimed to be protectors. Leopold’s force was surprised and driven off in headlong flight by companies from Schwyz and its local allies. The local leadership celebrated their victory with a new, more ambitious peace alliance joining Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden , while Emperor Louis the Bavarian responded to the defeat of his Habsburg rival by confirming the imperial liberty of the three valleys.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The pattern of local fragmentation entangled in imperial politics continued to encourage the construction of interlocking peace alliances all across southern Germany. Wherever lordship was weak – and the period’s economic crises and the Black Death weakened the nobility disproportionately – local peace alliances expanded in membership and in scope. Zurich , Berne , Lucerne , the three Inner Swiss valleys and various other entities established multiple, overlapping leagues, some of which were perpetual, rather than made for a fixed term. Communal entities with dubious claims to autonomy were particularly eager to bolster their position through such alliances. <a id="page_28" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> Lucerne, legally subject to Habsburg rule, was among the most aggressive in seeking allies both urban and rural, including a 1332 formal alliance with the three valley cantons, who were not only its local trading partners but also shared in the lucrative trade through the St Gotthard. Like most peace alliances, the 1332 treaty contained a clause nominally respecting Habsburg rights. However, Lucerne’s citizen elite had formed urban conspiracies that swore oaths of unity directed against their Habsburg bailiff in 1328 and 1332, making it evident that the alliance with Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden was intended to undermine the Habsburg position.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Political turmoil in the towns also shaped the network of local alliances. Most notably, an urban revolution in Zurich that installed a guild regime in 1336 became an important driver of events well into the 1350s. The city had gained imperial liberty under the nominal control of the abbess of the Fraumünster after the Duchy of Swabia dissolved. A council consisting at first of petty nobles, but increasingly dominated by a few merchant families, controlled the city. Craftsmen and poor denizens did not count as ‘burghers’ and had little influence, while the urban noble families felt excluded as well. As Zurich’s crafts thrived, the craftsmen’s guilds became more powerful and their exclusion from political influence began to exacerbate other tensions. Conflict reached a breaking point in 1336 when the urban craftsmen rose up under the leadership of an impoverished noble, Rudolf Brun, and established a new guild-based regime that exiled Brun’s chief rivals. Similar revolutions took place in many German cities in this period, and Zurich’s new constitution in fact closely followed the one established in Strasbourg in 1334.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Under the new constitution, Rudolf Brun became mayor for life, backed by a council of guildsmen and urban aristocrats, and spent most of the following decades seeking recognition of the city’s regime and his position in it. Since his merchant rivals had generally supported Habsburg authority in the region, Brun turned primarily to anti-Habsburg parties, including Constance , Schaffhausen and Basle , and gained imperial support from the Wittelsbach Emperor Louis IV and then from the Luxembourg Emperor Charles IV. Continuing struggles with the exiles, who had settled in nearby Rapperswil and attempted a coup in 1350, eventually produced a crisis. After efforts to reach an accommodation with local Habsburg <a id="page_29" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>agents failed and Archduke Albrecht II appeared near the city with troops, Brun established a permanent alliance with Lucerne, Uri and Schwyz in 1351. This treaty later became a model for further intra-Swiss leagues, though all parties retained the right to make future treaties, as was typical at the time. Although the situation for Zurich seemed dire, Austrian affairs once again distracted the Archduke, allowing Zurich and its allies to seize Glarus and Zug and impose similar alliance treaties on them. In 1353, Berne – part of an existing network of alliances further west – expanded its ties to the eastern network built around Zurich, Lucerne and the three valleys. The network of partners, though still unstable, was growing denser.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By the 1350s, two alternatives for organizing regional political life had emerged across Europe, which faced each other directly in the Swiss region: administration by lords who used new bureaucratic methods to build up effective peace-keeping, judicial and tax systems; or networks of semi-autonomous corporate communities linked by alliances that regulated regional policy, while each ally managed its own internal affairs. Both systems had roots reaching far back before 1350, but the economic and demographic crises that grew after the 1320s and culminated in the Black Death after 1347 weakened the lordly alternative even in well-administered kingdoms such as France and England, where the period after 1350 was characterized by disruption. The much less effective administration of central European dynasts like the Habsburgs suffered even more. Particularly in the band of territories from Italy to the Netherlands – characterized by stronger corporate organization than further east, but weaker noble administration than further west – the second alternative, government by corporate communities , thrived.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A key feature of both alternatives was the organization of government into territories that included all inhabitants, replacing geographically diffuse personal linkages of authority based on lordship and privilege. Lords and communal magistrates alike sought to bring everyone living in their domains, regardless of feudal status, under a uniform territorial law and its courts, paying taxes to a single territorial authority, and universally liable for military service to the territory’s ruler. The Habsburgs put great effort into consolidating a closed territory in the region by acquiring lordships, cloisters, and imperial territories through purchases or pledged loans <a id="page_30" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>(<span class="italic">Verpfändungen</span>) , and created a systematic register in 1307, the <span class="italic">Habsburg Urbar</span> , that listed their possessions and privileges. The costs of this strategy often strained the dynasty’s financial resources to their limits, and beyond.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The members of the Swiss alliances pursued similar goals, especially after the 1350s. Wealthy citizens and the city governments began purchasing vacant or indebted lordships , and also extended their jurisdiction by offering urban citizenship to individuals and whole communities outside the city walls. Berne was the most aggressive and most successful in these tactics, building up an urban territory that eventually made it the largest city-state north of the Alps. The rural cantons , too, sought to expand their lordship over new areas: Uri reached over the St Gotthard into the upper valley of the Ticino with a combination of alliances, military campaigns and purchases of territory, while Schwyz looked north to Lake Zurich and beyond.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Communes were intent on ruling over their acquisitions and their new subjects, just as lords were, though their distinctive political culture allowed for more consultation and inclusion of local elites in political affairs. Urban purchases of lordships, and especially the habit of making lords and communities outside the city walls citizens, clashed directly with the efforts of the Habsburgs and other regional dynasts to build their own closed territories. The intensification of governance, whether lordly or communal, ensured a rising level of clashes from 1352 to 1386. Rival claims, disputed jurisdictions, bribes , pressure and outright violence characterized the tactics on both sides of this struggle for territorial dominance. Although the legal and political framework continued to rest on lordship and privilege – which could be exercised by communes as well as by aristocrats – more and more participants recognized that rival systems with incompatible visions of political order were in conflict, thus adding ideological hostility to local power struggles taking place domain by domain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tensions rose throughout the 1360s and 1370s. In 1365, during a moment of Habsburg vulnerability, Schwyz simply seized Zug and forced the by no means reluctant population to ally with the Confederates. The Habsburgs, meanwhile, concentrated on controlling the strategic city of Basle , with considerable success in the late 1370s. In the early 1380s, Berne took advantage of a conflict within <a id="page_31" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>the divided noble family of Kyburg to absorb the strategic towns of Burgdorf and Thun . The papal schism after 1378 created additional fractures and pressures, since the pro-Avignonese Habsburgs faced mostly pro-Roman antagonists in southern Germany and Switzerland. War dragged on between France and England too, while civil strife inside the Italian city-states flared throughout this period (notably in the 1378 Ciompi revolt in Florence).</p>
<p class="calibre4">Significantly, six Confederate towns and communities passed a first common statute, the so-called <span class="italic">Pfaffenbrief</span> (Treaty on Clerics, also known as the Priests’ Charter), in 1370. This agreement added two critical innovations (absent in peace alliances) that demonstrate the growing control over their territories that the Swiss communities sought: a clause demanding that all inhabitants of communal territories (including nobles) swear fealty to the territory’s government, and a clause forbidding clerics from appealing to church courts except for internal and spiritual matters. The treaty, in which the six signatories (Zurich , Lucerne , Zug , Uri , Schwyz and Unterwalden ) described themselves for the first time as an <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718"><span class="italic">Eidgenossenschaft</span></a></span> (oath-comradeship), established a common law, thus turning what had begun as a network of peace alliances into a nascent territorial power.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The pivotal crisis for the future Switzerland came in 1386. On the Habsburg side, Duke Leopold III had become sole lord over the family’s western territories, including Switzerland, in a division of the dynasty’s patrimony in 1379. The division weakened both branches, and Leopold’s problems were exacerbated by his conflicts with Emperor Wenceslas as well as by financial pressure. On the Swiss side, Zurich feared the revival of its old foe Rapperswil , a Habsburg stronghold, while Lucerne resented the intrusive administration of the Habsburg bailiff over the city. Recognizing Leopold’s weakness, the cantons struck during the winter of 1385–6: Zurich seized Rapperswil and Lucernese bands raided Habsburg territories and awarded the inhabitants of several surrounding lordships urban citizenship (subverting their status as Habsburg subjects). After negotiations failed, Leopold raised an army and led it towards Lucerne in July 1386. At Sempach on 9 July, a smaller force from Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden inflicted a serious defeat on Leopold’s forces in which Leopold lost his life – killed, as later Habsburg propaganda put it, ‘by his own [subjects], on his own <a id="page_32" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>[territory], for the sake of his own [authority]’. Two years later, the German urban leagues faced their lords in a similar battle at Döffingen, where they lost as decisively as the Swiss had won.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-420"><img src="../images/00008.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">1.5 </span>Battle of Sempach. The Battle of Sempach helped consolidate the early Swiss alliances, and eventually became a focal point for the Confederacy’s emerging identity. A chapel erected in the 1470s, about a century after Sempach, commemorated the battle as part of the Confederacy’s founding. The mural depicted here was painted and repainted in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and highlights the ‘heroic deed’ of Arnold Winkelried – also first recorded in the 1470s – in seizing the enemy’s spears to open a breach in their defences.</div>
<p class="calibre4">The Battle of Sempach had both immediate and long-lasting consequences. In the short term, the death of Leopold and much of the local nobility who had accompanied him gave the cities and valleys a further advantage in building up their territories. Moreover, membership in the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718"><span class="italic">Eidgenossenschaft</span></a></span> became more attractive in light of the deep crisis of Habsburg power in the region. Basle’s council was able to turn back Habsburg influence and regain its freedom of movement, while the valley of Glarus gained membership in the Swiss alliance after a battle at Näfels in 1388. When Rudolf Schöno, mayor of Zurich, sought to swing the city back towards <a id="page_33" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> the Habsburg camp in 1393, pressure from its allies joined with internal dissent to force his removal and the city’s repudiation of the alliance . Instead, nine future cantons signed an agreement, the <span class="italic">Sempacherbrief</span> (Sempach treaty) that regulated their joint conduct of war. Meanwhile, rather than reaching a permanent peace, the Swiss and the Habsburgs – now leading territorial rivals – signed a series of extended truces that held until 1415.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Contemporaries fully recognized the significance of the battle: a legitimate lord had led an army of nobles to punish commoners who had seized his people and territory – and had been defeated. The two most dynamic political formations of the period, dynastic rulers and urban leagues , had faced off, and the leagues had won. Chroniclers all over Europe noted this strange event with concern, while the perfidy of the ‘rude peasants’ of Switzerland entered Habsburg family history as a lasting theme. For the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718"><span class="italic">Eidgenossen</span></a></span> themselves, the battle became a moment to commemorate God’s protection of their alliance from tyranny. A chapel to celebrate the victory was consecrated in 1387 and became the site of annual memorials. Only at the end of the fifteenth century did the story appear that one soldier, Arnold Winkelried , had swung the Battle of Sempach by throwing his body onto the wall of noble spears, thus opening a breach for his fellows; Winkelried’s supposed deed quickly became a core myth for the Swiss, illustrating the brave self-sacrifice that justified their autonomy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With this victory, and with the <span class="italic">Pfaffenbrief</span> and <span class="italic">Sempacherbrief</span> to regulate territorial jurisdiction and military affairs, the network of alliances in the region transcended its origins as a peacekeeping mechanism. Against external powers, most importantly the Habsburg dynasts with their many claims in the region, the Swiss had reached a stalemate of equals sustained in battle and in negotiations. Against local aristocrats , they had taken advantage of weakness to acquire many of their domains. Against villages, churches and other local institutions, they had proved capable of incorporating them, whether as citizens or subjects, into increasingly coherent territories. Backed by their alliances, the cantons were emboldened to reach out for more territory, accelerating the decline of the region’s remaining noble families. Contemporaries and the Swiss themselves recognized that a new political force, the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718"><span class="italic">Eidgenossenschaft</span></a></span>, now existed.</p>
<a id="page_34" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Nevertheless, the Confederacy of the 1390s was not in any sense a state, much less a nation. Importantly, no single document united all of the later cantons (usually considered to be eight, although Solothurn also signed the <span class="italic">Sempacherbrief</span>.) All of the cantons also remained part of the Empire, and continued to accept the legal framework of lordship and privilege by which the Empire operated. Each member retained the right to make further alliances and to follow its own interests, as long as new pacts did not directly contradict the existing ones. Political pressure to put the Swiss network above others did limit how far each canton could go, but Zurich and Berne in particular strenuously resisted any limits on their diplomatic freedom. Although all of the original eight cantons spoke German, and shared a certain contempt for Romance, especially Italian, mores and attitudes, their shared language did not in itself increase their cohesion or limit their alliances with neighbouring Romance-speaking communities or lords. As in the polyglot kingdoms around them, language played only a minimal role in Swiss nation-formation before the seventeenth century.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The members of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718"><span class="italic">Eidgenossenschaft</span></a></span> of 1393 had very different political interests, social structures and perspectives. Berne’ s politics lay primarily in the hands of a small group of families with noble estates outside the city, who looked mostly south and west in their ambitions, playing a complex game of alliance and rivalry with the Houses of Savoy and Burgundy . Zurich remained a manufacturing and trading city with interests south-east to the eastern Swiss passes and north-east to the textile and trading cities of St Gallen , Constance, Schaffhausen , and Ulm, none of which were then part of the Confederacy. The Inner Swiss (Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden) followed territorial interests south across the St Gotthard pass into Italy . The search for territorial opportunity brought some cantons up against others: Obwalden and Lucerne faced Berne to their west, while Schwyz and Zurich competed to their east. Finally, urban cantons had different horizons and different internal structures from the rural valley members of the Confederacy. Among the VIII cantons making up the alliance, Zurich , Berne and Lucerne contrasted with Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Glarus (with Zug halfway in between, structurally and socially). The citizens of the rural cantons often sympathized with rural communities under <a id="page_35" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>urban rule, whereas the cities were drawn towards their peers in southern Germany and down the Rhine. </p>
<p class="calibre4">The relatively open and heterogeneous political and social constellation that had given rise first to peace alliances , then to political leagues in the formation of the Swiss Confederacy, remained in place after 1386. What had changed was that the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718"><span class="italic">Eidgenossenschaft</span></a></span> of the Swiss was poised to take advantage of that openness as a group with shared interests. The course of events after 1386 belongs to the next segment of Switzerland’s history . Here, we will conclude with some highlights of the social and cultural developments that helped shape events into the 1400s.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-467"><span class="title">European culture and society in the Swiss lands</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The most important feature of Swiss society and culture in the High Middle Ages was its continued participation in the major trends that transformed Western Europe as a whole. Switzerland experienced depredations from the Magyars and Islamic raiders before 1000, like its neighbours, and recovered socially, economically and politically after 1000. Cities began to grow after 1050, and in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, houses of Dominican and Franciscan friars were popular, as they were elsewhere. The thorough penetration of Christian practices far into the mountains is demonstrated by the decorated church ceiling of Zillis in the Grisons Alps, dating to 1109–14. In 153 metre-square murals, themes from the Bible and the life of St Martin were vividly illustrated for the congregation. Local lords, and increasingly local communities, also found themselves forced to take sides in the great European ecclesio-political struggles of the Middle Ages, from the Investiture Conflict to the Great Schism. And not least, as in any agrarian society, the steady pulse of demography and rural production lay behind all other Swiss events in the period.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-472"><img src="../images/00009.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">1.6 </span>Annunciation to the Shepherds, Zillis, <span class="italic">c</span>. 1110. The elaborate mosaic of images painted on the ceiling of the church of St Martin in Zillis, on a major pass route through the Grisons, provides an unparalleled representation of popular religious culture in the region around 1100. Since the region’s population relied heavily on shepherding at the time, the Annunciation to the Shepherds was a natural topic for one of the images.</div>
<p class="calibre4">The most cataclysmic development affecting Switzerland before 1386 was the crisis of overpopulation beginning <span class="italic">c</span>. 1300 that reversed with the Black Death of 1347–9 – dates that correspond closely with the emergence of the Confederacy. Some evidence suggests that <span class="italic">c</span>. 1300 Swiss regions were less overpopulated than other parts of Europe, though the spread of Walser migrants into the <a id="page_36" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>highest valleys in the Alps during the 1200s demonstrates that the pressure to find new land was strong. The Black Death that ended this pressure affected the Swiss midlands severely, though the Alpine regions seem to have been less afflicted. The best estimates suggest that the territory comprising modern Switzerland went from some 800,000 inhabitants after 1300 to fewer than 600,000 by 1400, owing to repeated waves of plague. It is difficult to connect either overpopulation before 1347 or rapid population decline afterwards <a id="page_37" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>to specific political events, however. The guild revolution in Zurich in 1336 probably reflected economic pressure from high grain prices, but we lack direct evidence. Similarly, a major political crisis broke out in 1350, but no documents connect it directly to the Black Death. In general, we can say that the lesser aristocracy in particular faced economic as well as demographic headwinds in the late 1300s that made the growth and consolidation of communal polities easier, as seen in England, France and Italy as well as the German lands. It is also possible that the mountain valleys took on unusual significance in the Confederacy because they suffered less disruption from the plague than the midland cities, though intense (but poorly documented) social conflict took place in Uri in the late 1350s.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nineteenth- and twentieth-century Swiss historians of this period often highlighted the ‘peasant and herder’ societies of the Alpine valleys, arguing that strong local solidarity and wild, elemental courage made mountain warriors the backbone of Swiss autonomy. Several early battles in Swiss history were fought primarily by men from the mountains, and because of their prowess, mercenaries from Inner Switzerland found an eager welcome in Italy and beyond by 1400. The combination of poverty and inaccessible terrain, commercial pastoralism, connections to the outside world through the passes and the local strength of corporate organization did set these regions apart. In the romantic version of nineteenth-century writers, the democratic Inner Swiss fought bravely for freedom against tyrannical aristocrats because of the natural liberty of the mountain meadows, abetted by the physical toughness that the herder’s life demanded. Modern research has revealed how little democracy existed at the time, although the society of these valleys was characterized by a less vertical social hierarchy, more dependence of local elites on popular support and broader political participation than in most areas of Europe. The society of the Alpine valleys thus played a role in the Confederacy’s emergence, but most historians now agree that it is not the primary explanation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The midlands cities were more tightly bound to European developments and to the complex hierarchies of feudal Europe. Many historians have remarked that the Swiss cities combined features of Italian city-states and German imperial cities: they developed substantial territories like the Italians, but remained organized corporately like <a id="page_38" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>the Germans. All of the Swiss cities remained modest in size, and their cultural contributions were correspondingly modest. One illustrative achievement from the period is the Codex Manesse , a manuscript volume containing the richest surviving collection of late <span class="italic">Minnesang –</span> the German version of feudal love poetry – along with spiritual and didactic texts. Compiled in Zurich after 1300, it was a product not of the nobility, but of an urban family, the Manesse, who had aristocratic ambitions. Illustrated with 137 miniatures of knights at their adventures, and carefully ordered according to the noble status of each poem’s supposed author, the text illustrates how aristocratic values thrived in the heart of the urban commune . Many similar products reflecting aristocratic and Christian ideas <a id="page_39" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>and culture are found among the art, architecture and physical objects from the period.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-496"><img src="../images/00010.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">1.7 </span>Courtly culture in the towns. Among the whimsical images of lords and ladies in the Codex Manesse, produced for a successful burgher family in Zurich shortly after 1300, the scribe included one with his own name, Hadlaub. The book contains songs and poems from Europe’s aristocratic culture, which set the tone for the increasingly wealthy urban elites as well.</div>
<p class="calibre4">During a recent renovation undertaken on a house in Zurich, traces of the Jewish population of the medieval city came to light as well. Evidence about the small number of Jews present in Switzerland before 1347 is scant, although we know they experienced persecution ranging from accusations of ritual murder in Berne in 1294 to outright pogroms during the Black Death , as occurred all over Europe. In Zurich, a well-off Jewish family commissioned lively decorations on the walls of a stately townhouse on the Brunnenhof before 1349; a second community thrived in the late 1300s, leaving signs of what was probably a school and small synagogue on the Froschaugasse. Some twenty Jewish families lived in the city at the time, involved in money-lending and urban trade, before rising anti-Semitism in the fifteenth century once again led to their expulsion in 1436. Here too, Swiss patterns matched broader European trends in both timing and consequences.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the High Middle Ages, the region that produced the late medieval Swiss Confederacy and eventually the modern nation-state of Switzerland was an engaged participant in the culture of the medieval West as a whole. The region’s inhabitants took advantage of the openness of feudal society and politics to carve out their own set of political institutions , even as they continued to share in broader European cultural and social developments. After the Battle of Sempach , in which one of Europe’s leading aristocratic dynasts fell to a nameless commoner, Europeans recognized that this region and its emerging power system had characteristics that set it apart from others. As national states began to consolidate across Europe during the fifteenth century, the key issue was whether the loose <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3718"><span class="italic">Eidgenossenschaft</span></a></span> of 1400 would be reabsorbed by the emerging dynastic-administrative states around it, or whether the larger region’s structures were still sufficiently open for a different kind of state to emerge.</p>
