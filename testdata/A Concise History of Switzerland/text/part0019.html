<p class="noindent">If the Swiss had found themselves under a cloud immediately after 1945, they were soon able to compensate, thanks to the way history speeded up thereafter. In fact the post-war years saw probably the greatest and most rapid economic and social changes Switzerland has ever undergone. This, on top of their efforts in the war, led many Swiss, and some foreigners , to think of Switzerland as the ‘<span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall Schweiz</a></span>’, as an exceptional country: more prosperous, more harmonious, more democratic, more self reliant, more able to solve its problems and more moral than most other states. Switzerland’s exceptionalism was attributed to distinctive institutions like neutrality , federalism and direct democracy , and also to the way the Swiss coped with their social, religious and linguistic diversities within a nation-state, leading one foreign authority to call the country a ‘paradigm of integration’. In other words, the Swiss felt themselves, along with a benign Providence, to be the main authors of their own success.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They could point to the fact that, within thirty years of the end of the war, Switzerland had become a very rich country. It had also carved out a successful new international role for itself and had been able to overcome a series of challenges from linguistic division, a renewed anti-foreigner right, environmentalism and the post-1968 new left. These challenged both the direction Switzerland was taking and the new self-image behind Swiss confidence. Such challenges, however, like the recessions of the 1970s, were at first overcome, even as the country drifted once more to the right. However, by the <a id="page_228" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>late 1980s, fissures were beginning to appear in the Sonderfall , with arguments over the UN, Green issues and state security posing challenges that ultimately upset the complacency behind the whole <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> model.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-3029"><span class="title">A very Affluent Society</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The first element to be added to the wartime thinking about the Sonderfall was pride in the country’s rapid rise to enhanced prosperity, something that was to have a considerable impact on social and political behaviour. In fact, the dramatic economic growth that began in the early 1950s was the dominant factor in transforming <a id="page_229" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>both Switzerland and the way it was perceived. Because Swiss industries had not suffered war damage and could call on a fresh and well-educated labour force, the country was immediately able to supply consumer and capital goods on the increasing scale required by Germany and other countries as they rebuilt after the war. Industrial productivity soared, helped by a massive shift of employment from agriculture into the increasingly efficient manufacturing and service sectors. Manufacturing was progressively concentrated and focused on new industries. Total production tripled between 1960 and 1974 alone, with GDP growth rates rising as high as 12 per cent at times. The pattern of growth was also consistent, with only minor stutters in the mid-1960s. Not until the 1970s was there really any check to the upward movement of the Swiss economy.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-3036"><img src="../images/00050.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">8.1 </span>Multinational Switzerland. Much of the post-war Swiss economic miracle was driven by the country’s surprisingly large corps of multinational companies. First among these was the Nestlé food enterprise. Pictured here is its headquarters at Vevey on the northern shore of Lac Leman in the French-speaking canton of Vaud. However, this is only the brain of the company; its body, i.e. manufacturing and sales, is mostly based outside Switzerland.</div>
<p class="calibre4">A vast proportion of Switzerland’s growing output was exporte d, increasingly to the rest of Europe , which by 1974 absorbed two-thirds of Swiss exports, the value of which rose consistently. Switzerland made up part of the ‘blue banana’ zone, stretching southwards from London to Lombardy , which was the driving force of the European economy. Growth helped to build up large multinationals like Nestlé and Brown Boveri along with chemical firms like Hoffman and CIBA. By 1970, though the Swiss then made up only 0.15 per cent of the world’s population, they were responsible for 2 per cent of global trade . The deficit in the balance of trade caused by the cost of importing fuel and raw materials was made up by growing income from thriving tourism and other invisible exports. Services thus expanded, notably with Swiss banks proving increasingly attractive to outsiders. Already in the mid-1950s, Harold Wilson felt it necessary to attack the ‘gnomes of Zurich’ for speculating against sterling. Books appeared on the Swiss economic and financial empire, both from the Swiss and from outsiders like T. R. Fehrenbach, who in 1966 wrote a detailed study of the <span class="italic">Gnomes</span> and their power. Economic growth , in other words, provided the first new pillar of the Sonderfall as well as generally enhancing the country’s image. It was therefore true of the Swiss that ‘they had never had it so good’.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Prosperity was reinforced by social change. Switzerland became a bigger, more mobile, more affluent and more cultured society. The population rose to 6.3 million by 1970, owing mainly to the influx of workers from other countries who were needed to sustain high <a id="page_230" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>levels of economic growth. Significantly, many Swiss did not call them guest workers (<span class="italic">Gastarbeiter</span>), as did the Germans, but less welcomingly <span class="italic">Fremdarbeiter</span> or ‘foreign workers’. By 1970, non-native inhabitants numbered over a million, or 17.2 per cent of the population. Population growth accelerated urbanization and density while individuals also became more mobile. As the agricultural segment shrank, with 100,000 farms disappearing between 1940 and 1980, many people moved out of the mountain regions. Others moved from over-crowded city centres into new suburbs. Motorization made commuting much easier, but also enabled some industry to move into more rural areas. A second form of mobility resulted from the move into service s and the arrival of foreign workers willing to take over low paid and routine jobs from the Swiss: a new middle class emerged, much of which was employed rather than being entrepreneurs. The expansion of higher education also allowed young people to move out of their home regions and to climb the social ladder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Some authorities began to feel that Switzerland was ceasing to be a class society. It had certainly become a more equal society, since the wealth generated by economic growth was relatively fairly shared. Wages rose 250 per cent – often faster than GDP – in the thirty years after the war, compared to only 66 per cent in pre-war decades; in consequence, the share of income enjoyed by the top decile fell while that of lower ones grew. The increasing availability of welfare accelerated the decline of poverty , as did the virtual disappearance of unemployment . Switzerland became a high-wage, high-price economy whose growing purchasing power also made it a wealthy consumer society. Holidays, housing, medical care, cars and recreational spending all soared. Savings rose tenfold, and the Stock Exchange nearly eightfold. The rise of consumer associations in the early 1960s, along with the emergence of shopping centres and especially supermarket chains like the Coop, Denner and Migros , also corresponded to shifts in both wealth and outlook. Migros became the dominant retail force in Switzerland, spreading from groceries into education , leisure, bank ing and gardening, although not into alcohol. At the same time, even though the relative size of the public sector declined, the country invested heavily in high-quality public infrastructure, including airports, good motorways and even, by 1980, a road tunnel under the St Gotthard . Measured quality of <a id="page_231" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>life improved greatly, with life expectancy soaring thanks to enhanced public health, while crime and industrial unrest ran at remarkably low levels.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Switzerland was also becoming a more educated and aware society, as schools improved and its many newspapers doubled their print runs. The first racy tabloid, <span class="italic">Blick</span>, appeared in 1959, and entertainment became more easily available after television made its appearance in 1953. The Swiss participated in European culture, providing a number of leading film actors and directors, notably Jean-Luc Godard and Alain Tanner. Switzerland also became a more multi-lingual country, since the arrival of foreign workers, at first from Italy and then from further abroad, meant that more languages were spoken by greater numbers. Mobility and education meant that more native Swiss were likely to speak another national language too. Immigration changed the religious balance by increasing the number of Catholics , although the growing secularization of Europe an society also affected Switzerland: increasing numbers refused to fill in the religious question on the census form, suggesting that they had no religious beliefs. Yet, despite the increase in diversity, social harmony and stability came to constitute a second new pillar of the Sonderfall .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Politically, developments at home and abroad reinforced Swiss feelings that they had found a winning recipe. Domestically, reformism continued to subside. An unemployment insurance scheme was approved in 1951 and the Social Democrats won an extra parliamentary seat, but the centre-right did better. Then, in 1953, the people rejected tax increases proposed by the Social Democratic Finance Minister Max Weber ; when he resigned in pique, the party was again left outside the government, even though it won additional seats in 1955. In 1958, the electorate also rejected a law banning cartels, of which there were some 600. The government’s wartime emergency powers lapsed whereas Conjunctural Articles , allowing it to act in case of depression, were held up until 1964.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-3085"><img src="../images/00051.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">8.2 </span>Women and politics. A highly symbolic photo of the long-standing denial of women’s political rights. It shows a woman who had the temerity to try to attend the 1946 annual Landsgemeinde of Appenzell Ausserrhoden in Trogen being summarily and emphatically directed to leave by a policeman. Women’s suffrage was slower coming to Switzerland than in other European countries owing to conservative masculine resistance. Some Francophone cantons gave women the vote in the late 1950s, but a national initiative failed in 1959. Protests continued, but only in 1971 did a votation succeed, after which women made rapid progress politically.</div>
<p class="calibre4">In fact a certain depoliticization became visible domestically. With the collective cake growing larger, there seemed to be less need for argument or government intervention. With fewer conflicts over the distribution of resources and a decreasing desire to rock the consumerist ship, the number of problematic initiatives fell. Turnout for both <a id="page_232" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_233" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>votations and elections also began to decline. Politics, in other words, seemed less necessary, and fewer voters supported innovations like female suffrage , which, despite defeats at cantonal level, was put to the vote nationally in 1959 and comprehensively defeated. Women were given the vote in Geneva, Neuchâtel and Vaud, however, ensuring that the idea did not die. Overall, politics appeared to be giving way to optimistic managerialism and to the pursuit of consumer ism and entertainment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Declining contention encouraged the parties to move towards the centre, reinforcing tendencies towards compromise and consultation. Thus, the communistic Labour Party was marginalized, while the Social Democratic party saw its traditional constituency shrinking and becoming less ideological. Trade union membership also dropped, despite the unions being fully involved in economic policy-making. The SPS had therefore to change its tune, refraining from launching provocative constitutional initiatives and dropping Marxist elements from its programme at Winterthur in 1959. The party’s about-turn partly paid off: although it lost ground electorally in 1959, it still gained the two seats on the Federal Council that its support had long justified, and for which the Conservative–Christian–Social People’s Party, as the Catholic Conservatives had become in 1957, had been pushing. The 1959 recasting of the Federal Council created the so-called Magic Formula of two Radicals, two Catholics, two Socialists and one member of the Peasant Party, almost precisely reflecting the parties’ shares of the electorate. Remarkably, both remained relatively stable until the end of the century. In line with this trend, the Conservatives in 1970 again renamed themselves as the Christian Democratic People’s party , seeking to move outside the Catholic laager and liberalize in line with Vatican II. However, the implosion of Catholic supportive organizations in the face of secularization and social change limited its growth. The next year, the BGB became the Swiss People’s Party after a merger with the old Democratic Party , in an initially unsuccessful attempt to widen its appeal beyond the declining farming community.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This regression towards the centre produced increasingly harmonious politics, making it possible to agree on a permanent limitation to the size of the National Council . This was fixed at 200 from the 1963 elections onward. Concordance democracy that sought consensual <a id="page_234" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>policy-making also increased, furthered by the enhanced role given to organized interests in policy-making through new consultation processes. The Swiss became increasingly proud of their political cooperation, moderation and democracy , elements that came to be seen as a further pillar of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span>. Indeed, for one English politician, the Swiss had succeeded in taking the conflict out of politics. The novelist Paul Erdman suggested a slightly dimmer view in his novel <span class="italic">The Crash of ’79</span>, in which everything in Switzerland was efficiently decided by a handful of top businessmen and politicians working in cahoots. Even though meant critically, Erdman’s picture reinforced the commonly held view that Switzerland, by the 1960s, had become surprisingly well off and remarkably well integrated.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-3109"><span class="title">A New International Role</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Domestic achievements were not the only new elements to be added to the Sonderfall in the post-war years. Diplomatic developments also reinforced the image as the country came in from the cold. Switzerland may have remained outside major institutions like the UN , but it still carved out a new – and well-recognized – role for itself as an active neutral and as a key member of EFTA . However, it was also surreptitiously developing new links with NATO . And its new role was not exempt from domestic criticism.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the early 1950s, although defensiveness and resentment over criticism of its wartime record continued, accentuated by the necessity of signing a 1951 deal with the US COCOM authority that banned Switzerland from exporting arms to the East, the country increasingly came to see the real threat to its independence as coming from the USSR . Although the USSR formally recognized Swiss neutrality in 1955, and even though Switzerland stayed out of NATO and emphasized the solidaristic side of its neutrality, much of its strategic thinking and military preparation assumed that it was on the side of the West. Officially, however, Switzerland presented itself as a locking ‘device’ between East and West, giving both sides the assurance that Switzerland would neither attack them nor allow its territory to be used by the other side. To develop the country’s commitment to solidarity as well as neutrality, Switzerland joined an increasing number of UN agencies, many of which had offices in <a id="page_235" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Geneva. On occasions, it did apply UN sanctions, as well as becoming an Observer in the Council of Europe . Switzerland also provided mediation and other good offices in conflicts such as the Korean, Algerian and Vietnam wars.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Formal neutrality between East and West did not stop the government from purging leftists from the civil service , warning the public against eastern propaganda, and secretly surveilling possible communist sympathizers, such was the strength of its anti-communism. Ten thousand Hungarian refugees were warmly welcomed after the 1956 uprising. At the same time – although this was only revealed much later – the government set up an organization known as Project 26, designed to create a shadow government and guerrilla force in liaison with NATO’s Gladio network in case the Red Army rolled into Switzerland. Official military strategy moved from resistance based on the Alps to a mobile defence designed to hold off the Soviets for fifteen days until NATO could come to the rescue. This strategic posture was built into a new military concept in 1966. The Swiss also toyed with the idea of acquiring nuclear weapons, but this was soon set aside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The development of Europe an integration posed Switzerland new problems. The government was uneasy about the formation of the Coal and Steel Community and then the Europe an Economic Community, since they threatened to constrain Switzerland’s economic and political autonomy. Swiss foreign policy therefore supported the idea of a large Free Trade Area and, when that failed, fell in with the UK’s fallback suggestion of a small free trade area. Switzerland was therefore active in the formation of EFTA in 1960. EFTA seemed to be a stepping-stone towards more involvement in Europe, since the government finally accepted that the Council of Europe did not threaten its sovereignty and became a full member in 1963. Three years later Switzerland entered GATT . However, since EFTA had been designed as a rival to the EC, the British application to join the latter cast EFTA into doubt. At first, Switzerland was disturbed by the British switch, and the government briefly considered association with the EC. Soon, however, EFTA became a very satisfactory means of managing small-state relations with the EC, and in 1972, Switzerland was one of a number of EFTA states which signed free-trade agreements with Brussels. This proved a very adequate <a id="page_236" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>arrangement, providing free access for Swiss goods but without incurring any of the burdens of membership. Many sectoral deals were to follow, leading the Swiss to think that they had developed a ‘third way ’ that avoided either membership or marginalization.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This pragmatic success, along with what was seen as a successful inoculation against the Cold War , was generally popular. It reinforced the feeling that Switzerland was doing exceptionally well by adding helpful self-reliance to its other achievements, in line with <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3746"><span class="italic">Willensnation</span></a></span> thinking. As a result, thinkers in the 1960s started using the term <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> to describe the country’s singularly fortunate condition. The term was first spelled out by anti-immigrant writers such as Adolf Guggenbühl in his 1967 essay ‘Die Schweizer sind anders’ (‘The Swiss are different’). Such views were reinforced by the way the country rode out the oil crisis relatively unscathed, whereas neighbouring states suffered badly. Growing faith in Swiss exceptionalism reinforced the defensive, often hedgehog -like attitudes developed during the war, because awareness remained of the apparent fragility of the newly found success. Defensiveness, psychological as well as military, lay behind the 1962 establishment of the Civil Protection Office and the requirement that all new houses have nuclear shelters, even if these were usually used as wine or paint stores. The government also moved provisionally to replace <span class="italic">Rufst du</span> by the Swiss Hymn as the national anthem, a move made permanent in 1978.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Such attitudes did not go unquestioned. At first among intellectuals and then among other political forces, the country’s transformation was consistently challenged. Max Frisch ’s 1954 novel <span class="italic">Stiller</span> sharply challenged the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> , as did writers such as Karl Schmidt and Max Imboden . Their books, <span class="italic">Unbehagen im Kleinstaat</span> and <span class="italic">Helvetisches Malaise</span> respectively, were hostile to the agenda of growth at all costs and to the commercialization of all human connections. A cottage industry of soul-searching books about a Swiss malaise developed, encouraged by a scandal over the purchase of Mirage fighters to replace British Hawker Hunters that led to a formal parliamentary inquiry in 1964, which condemned the lack of ministerial control that had let costs escalate. As a result, fewer planes were bought and Defence Minister Paul Chaudet decided not to stand for re-election in 1966. The government also agreed, in <a id="page_237" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> future, to submit its policy strategy to Parliament for approval, and to redefine its relationship with the cantons. The following year’s elections saw the unconventional centrist Landesring make significant gains as voters protested against the failings of the system. The Labour (or Communist) Party also won two more seats, even after the Prague Spring prompted a new burst of anti-communism. There was even talk of the necessity for a complete revision of the Constitution , which had swollen considerably over the years, thanks to additions written in through popular initiatives. Some also felt the constitution to be out of line with modern liberal thinking. The breach between <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> thinking and critical intellectuals came to a head in 1969 when a long-delayed government civil defence booklet, written by Albert Bachman , the founder of the P26 secret army organization and by then a fierce anti-communist and soon to be head of Swiss intelligence services, went beyond shelters by calling for social discipline and warning against flirting with left-wing and non-Swiss ideas. The booklet caused a wave of protest and a split in the Swiss Writers’ Association, as the critics noisily dissociated themselves from conservative views. Although such criticisms were rarely noted outside, they were a foretaste of new challenges and splits that were developing, partly in response to the new affluence the country was enjoying. Indeed, while the country adopted William Tell ’s crossbow as its symbol of Swiss quality, mainstream historians were becoming increasingly critical both of the liberation saga and of prevailing Swiss conservatism.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-3161"><span class="title">New Challenges</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">From the early 1960s the country had to face new challenges. The first of these, which was probably the most noted outside, concerned the Jura question, which was to run into the late 1970s. But there was also a significant new anti-foreigner movement that often came within an ace of rewriting the rules on population numbers. The New Left surge that derived from the events of May 1968 in France also had a lasting effect on Swiss politics, including through its encouragement of environmentalism . Although the new forces severely challenged the Sonderfall status quo, however, this proved able to absorb them.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-3168"><img src="../images/00052.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">8.3 </span>A photograph of a big demonstration for Jurassian independence, held in Delemont on 20 March 1965. The central placard saying ‘in French’ sums up the motivation of the movement. Other placards denounce mistreatment by Berne and concessions made to other cantons, and also call for liberty. The large size of the demonstration is symbolic of the militancy of the separatist campaign, which also involved small-scale violence. This continued for a while into the 1980s, because the new canton did not include Moutiers and the other French-speaking parts of the southern Jura. Their inclusion in the new canton may soon be put to a popular vote.</div>
<a id="page_238" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">The status quo was initially threatened by a resurgence of language conflict after the Bernese electorate, in 1959, roundly defeated a call by the Rassemblement Jurassien (RJ) to allow a right of secession for the Bernese Jura. The RJ appealed for outside help, while its underground youth wing, the Beliers, embarked on a campaign of minor violence: dynamiting railway lines, attacking the local arsenal and setting fire to buildings. The Federal Council stepped in, and in 1969–70 the Berne se accepted an amendment to the cantonal constitution that recognized the existence of a Jurassian people and allowed for a series of votes on autonomy. The resolution of such a potentially damaging problem was hailed as another <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> achievement.</p>
<a id="page_239" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4"> Interestingly, attempts to form a language-based Romand party came to nothing, as did moves to reunite the two Basle half-cantons in 1969, since the rural population did not wish to share the city’s higher costs. However, the city became the first German-speaking canton to give women the vote, reflecting growing pressure on the issue. Indeed, the cantons remained important sites of innovation in the 1960s and 1970s, leading the way on constitutional revision as well as on women’s suffrage , and accounting for a growing share of state expenditure. However, they also turned to the centre for new subsidies for the universities in 1966. Ultimately, reform of the federal –cantonal relationship was a key element of the national constitutional revision process then getting under way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">An even more significant complicating factor in further evolution of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> was renewed opposition to ‘<span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3742"><span class="italic">Überfremdung</span></a></span>’ as opponents of immigration characterized it. The surge in worker immigration had proved to be nowhere near as temporary as had been assumed after the war, and the growing population of near-permanent immigrants worried many. Although clearly a by-product of the new prosperity, it also seemed to challenge the conservative view of Swiss identity on which the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> idea rested. Immigration thus proved to be a very emotive issue that cut across the political landscape: worried trade unionists in the 1950s sought to curb numbers, while conservative single-issue parties against immigration emerged in the 1960s. Chief among these was the Nationale Aktion gegen die Überfremdung von Volk und Heimat (NA), the first anti-migrant party in Europe. Although the government took some first steps to control numbers and to examine the problems posed by migration, this did not dissuade the NA and others from tabling initiatives to reduce the number of foreigners in the population. These were then withdrawn to make room for a proposal by a leading right-wing publicist, James Schwarzenbach . He had been recruited by the NA and in 1967 became its first representative in Parliament. His initiative called for a decrease of 400,000 foreigners and a permanent quota on non-citizen residents. The hard-fought campaign over the initiative caused a real political crisis before it was defeated by 54 per cent to 46 per cent in 1970.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This was far from the end of the story: fear of foreigners continued to be a hot political issue, fuelled by concessions on families which the government had to make when it renegotiated an accord <a id="page_240" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> with Italy . In 1971 the NA gained four seats in the lower house, while Schwarzenbach’s new Republican Movement, a 1970 breakaway prompted by the NA’s increasing extremism, won seven seats. However, two further anti-foreigner initiatives, directed against ‘overpopulation’ and easier naturalization, were easily defeated once a Europe-wide depression set in. One of the ironies of the situation was that the massive use of cheap foreign labour had probably been a disincentive to technological modernization in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3742"><span class="italic">Überfremdung</span></a></span> movement criticized aspects of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> from a traditional nativist position, the events of May 1968 in France helped to stimulate a wider challenge from the left. The upheaval of 1968 fostered the emergence of a range of ‘new’ left -wing parties, such as Trotskyists, Maoists and neo-Stalinists, some of which succeeded in entering Parliament, while others helped develop new extra-parliamentary social protest movements. Sometimes these turned to existing channels, leading to a surge in the use of direct democracy , with some years recording eight times as many initiatives as before 1968. The number of successful initiatives did not increase, however. The spirit of 1968 also manifested itself in violent demonstrations for Alternative Youth Centres, which began at the Globus building in Zurich in 1968 and spread to Geneva, Lausanne, Bienne, Basle, Berne and Lugano by 1973. Such centres encouraged a new youth culture and lifestyle that had little time for orthodox political activity, let alone for the army . The movement made conscientious objection, then still virtually a crime, fashionable, much to the alarm of the establishment. It also boosted the use of Schwyzerdütsch, producing the so-called <span class="italic">Mundartwelle</span>, a wave of dialect usage that began to dominate the media, politics and even academia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The events of 1968 encouraged change in two main policy areas. One was the rights of women , who finally got the vote in 1971 with support from as large a majority as had been against the idea in 1959. The vote followed increased pressure from women’s organizations and the embarrassment of having to consider opting out of parts of the European Convention on Human Rights, which the country had yet to accept, because of the disenfranchisement of women. The initiative also benefited from the fading stress on the comradeship of the (masculine) army that had spared Switzerland in the war – a <a id="page_241" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>view which left little room for female emancipation. The first women – eleven in all – entered Parliament that autumn, and progress thereafter was surprisingly rapid: by 1981, gender equality was written into the Constitution . Again, the pacific solution of this long-standing anomaly was seen by some as an element of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> .</p>
<p class="calibre4">The other area of change came in political environmentalism. The first environmental party emerged in Neuchâtel in 1971 in opposition to a planned lakeside motorway, but environmentalism really took off with protests against nuclear power when planning permission for the Kaiseraugst power reactor came up for renewal. A site of considerable archaeological significance close to left-wing Basle, Kaiseraugst mobilized resistance to atomic energy, including a large-scale occupation in April 1975. The Federal Council was forced to negotiate with the demonstrators, and though the occupation was ended, it dealt a severe blow to nuclear power. Several initiatives demanding a moratorium on nuclear power were launched, and Whitsun anti-nuclear marches became an established part of the political scene. So did concern about nuclear waste. The damaging 1976 chemical spillage at Roche’s Seveso plant in northern Italy also helped to push environmental concerns beyond mere protest and into mainstream politics. Environmental initiatives attracted up to 30 per cent of those voting, so that from the late 1970s, ecological parties began to emerge, winning municipal seats. In 1979, Daniel Brelaz of Lausanne was elected the first Green MP in Europe. A new law enshrining the principle of ‘the polluter pays’ entered the statute book, and the political system seemed to be innovative and flexible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">These new forms of left-wing politics sprang in large part from a new middle-class generation that had not experienced the 1930s and 1940s, and whose members were critical of the consumer ism, xenophobia and repressive tolerance of their times. Despite being educated and well off, they felt themselves powerless against the legacy of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> . This segment often sought progressive change at home and more help for the Third World , ideas that were equally vigorously resisted, notably by right-wing Radicals . Indeed, in 1971 both the Social Democrats and the Landesring lost ground, while the far right gained and the Radicals re-emerged as the largest party, suggesting that the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> was still intact, despite the pressures it had had to endure.</p>
<a id="page_242" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><h3 class="sec" id="c19444-3222"><span class="title">Riding out the Recession</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Indeed, many came to see the way the country was able to cope with the economic depression of the 1970s as further proof of its special status. Unemployment remained very low and the overall economic situation remained comparatively rosy. By the early 1980s, after the second oil shock had been overcome, the country began to return to its centre-right leanings.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nonetheless, by 1975, the Social Democrats regained the top spot, since the far right promptly lost half its seats. The rapid swing reflected the fact that the country was caught up in the international economic crisis unleashed by the oil-price shock of 1973. Switzerland, like most western countries, had become dependent on imported oil for three-quarters of its energy consumption, which had risen fourfold between 1950 and 1970. Increased oil prices caused rising inflation along with declining domestic demand and foreign exports. Growth ground to a virtual halt in 1973–6 and again in 1978–81 as industrial production and investment fell off. The watch industry suffered particularly, because it had not kept up with the widening use of quartz and mass production, even though it had helped to pioneer the new technology.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Economic stagnation slowed social mobility as wages began to slide and access to property ownership became more difficult. As a result, income disparities rose along with taxes. However, although 365,000 jobs, or 12 per cent of the total, were lost and as many workers went on short time, the Swiss did not suffer from unemployment as much as most of the developed world. The unemployed rose from a few hundred at the beginning of the decade to only 25,000 in 1974–6; instead, a large number of foreign workers did not have their contracts renewed and left Switzerland. Once back home, they often stayed, since they were not entitled to Swiss unemployment pay. The number of new <span class="italic">Fremdarbeiter</span> coming to Switzerland halved in the second half of the decade. All in all, about 175,000 left the country, accounting for half the jobs lost.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The economic downturn limited labour unrest, but it probably also helped to defeat new attempts to restrict the number of foreigners. The idea was wonderfully satirized in a hilarious 1978 film by Rolf Lyssy called <span class="italic">The Swissmakers</span> , which derided the way in which citizenship applications from spaghetti-eating Italians were handled. <a id="page_243" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>It became the most watched film in Switzerland before <span class="italic">Titanic</span>, suggesting that many Swiss did not take the NA ’s ideas too seriously. Indeed, the latter made an attempt in the late 1970s to moderate its image, allowing it to continue influencing legislation on migration into the early 1980s. However, asylum policy was significantly liberalized in 1979, something which was to have a considerable impact.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Policy began to swing towards the left, along with Parliament . Welfare policy became more active, with price controls coming in after 1972, along with new Conjunctural Articles in 1978. Social security expanded, with reforms to old-age pensions in 1974, bringing in the three-pillar system of state, occupational and private provision. Three years later, unemployment insurance was made obligatory. Even if the country was moving closer towards a normal West Europe an welfare democracy, the SPS was still unable to push through proposals for a Value Added Tax (VAT), a wealth tax and industrial co-determination (<span class="italic">Mitbestimmungsrecht</span>), let alone policies for better integration of foreigners .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Foreign policy was not greatly changed by the depression, despite being in Social Democratic hands throughout the decade. Switzerland continued to evolve hesitantly towards more openness and solidarity, but with considerable limitations. The first official visit to Moscow took place in 1973, and the country became more sympathetic to the wider world, as seen in responses to South Africa and the Chilean crisis. However, it proved far less willing to admit refugees then than it had been in 1956. The Swiss also threw a good deal of effort into the Helsinki process, proposing wide-ranging arbitration and mediation procedures in collaboration with other European neutrals and non-aligned states. Switzerland finally signed the ECHR in 1974, but did not ratify the European Social Charter. In 1976, led by the far right, the electorate resoundingly defeated a proposed loan to the International Development Agency. This corresponded to the way Switzerland stood alongside other capitalist industrial countries in the Paris Conference on North–South relations. Under Pierre Aubert , foreign minister from 1978, new efforts began to develop relations with the Third World and with the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The ongoing shifts in Swiss political culture did help to reinforce ideas of domestic harmony by pushing forward the democratic <a id="page_244" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>processes needed to solve the Jura question. A 1974 vote accepted the idea, but not the boundaries, of a new canton: the Protestant elements of the South Jura, whose historic and geographic connections with Berne were closer than those of the Catholic north, largely voted against the idea. The actual frontier was decided by further referenda in 1975, which paved the way for the creation of the twenty-third canton in 1978–9. This, along with the way the country had escaped the worst of the European recession, served to reassure many Swiss that they were still a <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> . Nevertheless, resentment amongst Jurassian nationalists, who wanted the whole region, persisted in an unsettling way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The ‘youth troubles’ that flared up at the end of the decade also helped to push mainstream Swiss society back towards the right. The second oil shock seems to have made many young people realize that their educational, job and political prospects were much diminished. The perceived deception and immorality of the age of affluence came under increasing attack, as in Fritz Zorn’s powerful novel <span class="italic">Mars</span> and later in Alain Tanner’s film <span class="italic">Messidor</span> . Anti-establishment feelings among the young were given a powerful new focus by the decision of the Zurich City Council to spend millions refurbishing the Opera House while closing facilities for the young and their rock culture. The decision sparked major demonstrations, which were met with violence. Attempts were made to ban a film about the troubles called <span class="italic">Zurich Burns</span>. Such heavy-handed responses provoked a further wave of riots and protests in Zurich and other major cities. The Autonomous Youth Centre in Zurich then reopened in the spring of 1981 under Church supervision, but remained under pressure because of fears over drug use. The internal contradictions of the youth movement led to its decline after 1982. Nonetheless, debate on the ‘youth problem’ was abundant, including a government report that accepted the reality of alienation, much to the annoyance of some conservatives. To the establishment, the emergence of a counter-culture prepared to use violence seemed a real threat to the rule of law and the Swiss way of life. The establishment had earlier also been distressed by the publication of <span class="italic">Das Boot ist Voll</span> , Alfred Häsler’s critique of Swiss refugee policy during the Second World War, a book that had considerable impact even though it did not directly challenge the country’s role in the war.</p>
<a id="page_245" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4"> These developments help to explain a swing to the right that began in the late 1970s. In 1979 the Social Democrats and the Landesring both lost seats, as did the Republikaner, the secessionists from the NA, while the orthodox right gained, with the FDP leading the way. This pattern was continued four years later when the Social Democrats lost a further four seats, and the far left also slumped, allowing the Radicals to re-emerge as the largest party. The FDP was then emboldened to launch its first initiative in many years, on the harmonization of the school year. When the Social Democrats put forward the first-ever female nomination for the Federal Council , that of Zurich MP Lilian Uechtenhagen , she was turned down. Her perceived extremism encouraged the conservative parties to prefer Otto Stich of Solothurn. In fact, the choice of Uechtenhagen reflected the way the SPS was being undermined by divisions between its moderate membership and aggressive intellectual left-wing leaders. The SPS’s reaction to her rejection was to threaten to pull out of the Magic Formula , which would set off a crisis in Swiss politics. In the end, wiser counsels prevailed, but the unfavourable image generated by internal animosities was very damaging to the party. The fact that, later the same year, the electorate roundly rejected the party’s initiative on banning bank secrecy did not help.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The shift rightwards, along with a renewed surge in the foreign population, also helped to revive the far right. The surge came about partly because economic growth created demand for yet more <span class="italic">Fremdarbeiter</span> and partly because the new asylum law encouraged applications from many Tamils fleeing the civil war in Sri Lanka. The rightist revival showed itself first in the crushing 1981 defeat of the left’s Être Solidaire initiative, which proposed better treatment for foreign workers, and then in new NA extremism. The electorate rejected a new foreigners ’ law in 1982, and the NA launched yet another initiative against immigration . When the far-right Vigilance Party won 20 per cent of the vote in Geneva, the government moved to revise its asylum legislation in 1983, and went on in succeeding years to toughen its stance on foreigners. The far right’s worry about the ability of foreigners to buy landed property in Switzerland was answered by the restrictive <span class="italic">Lex Friedrich</span> of 1985.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The right had far less success on environmental issues, which proved an even bigger problem after revelations in 1983–4 that the country’s <a id="page_246" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>forests were apparently dying. This led to a special session of Parliament and new legislation, the need for which was underlined by the Chernobyl nuclear explosion and especially the Schweizerhalle chemical-spill disaster of November 1986. Failure to deal adequately with a fire at the Sandoz chemicals plant, near Basle, allowed tons of toxic chemicals to escape into the Rhine , with dire effects . The slow public response to the disaster helped to undermine confidence, at home and abroad, in Swiss standards of environmental protection. The foundation in 1985 by Reaganite businessman Michel Dreher of the Automobile Party , which campaigned for motorists and against ‘ecological gauchism’ and asylum-seekers, showed there was resistance to the new trend. The AP enjoyed modest electoral success for a while, but the number of Green parties also grew, and from 1983, they joined in a loose federation .</p>
<p class="calibre4">Attitudes began to swing right in some other areas, as could be seen with another rejection of a VAT proposal in 1979 and resistance to the extension of female rights. An updated marriage law was opposed by small businesses because it meant giving some control to proprietors’ wives, which, opponents argued, would break up firms. Nonetheless, the law survived a challenge. The long-awaited project to make a reality of the constitutional commitment to maternity insurance was rejected in December 1987, however, revealing continuing doubts about female emancipation even though the country was making considerable progress in this respect. Traditionalists also joined the establishment in resisting pacifist and environmentalist opposition to the army and its needs, notably for new training grounds and expenditure. Hostility to conscientious objection remained intense. In other words, the Sonderfall and its supporters continued to exercise a controlling influence on Swiss politics and society.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-3286"><span class="title">Conflicting Currents</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">However, while right-wing thinking continued to lead government policy and to block attempts to change the Sonderfall ’s default setting of self-exclusion from the UN , all this was subject to real challenge as the 1980s wore on. This was especially the case where the army and the environment were concerned. The overall role of the state also attracted massive criticism, thanks to revelations about its <a id="page_247" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>past security policy. In other words, real fissures in the Sonderfall began to open up as new forces came into conflict.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Government policy also responded to the spread of more conservative economic ideas in the developed world during the 1980s. The state made limited moves towards deregulation by lifting price controls and some regulatory burdens on banks , and by encouraging local commercial radio stations. Some commentators even discerned a Swiss version of Thatcherism at this time, and worried about the future the social services faced with privatization and deregulation. Neo-liberal policies advanced once the Radicals selected the first woman Federal Councillor and Minister in October 1984 in Elizabeth Kopp , MP, a 48-year-old lawyer from Zurich. She took over the Police and Justice Ministry and became known as the country’s ‘Iron Lady’, although she also gave further impetus to women’s rights. One Social Democratic minister went as far as to accuse her party of wanting to dismantle the welfare state. Such claims were exaggerated, given that the decade saw major reform in both unemployment insurance and occupational pensions. However, the FDP did indeed campaign for ‘Less of the State’. The same period saw a renewal of the SVP, whose Zurich wing, under the leadership of a wealthy entrepreneur, Christoph Blocher , was developing new sections, strategies and structures. Blocher’s family originally came to Switzerland from Württemberg in the mid-nineteenth century. His grandfather had been a German-language activist and founder of an anti-League of Nations alliance, while he himself was the seventh child of a Protestant pastor from north-eastern Switzerland. Educated in law and agriculture, Blocher inherited conservative views. After a very successful business career with Ems Chemicals, where he rose to become president and chief shareholder, he entered politics at the local level with the SVP, since he distrusted the Radicals . By 1977, he was head of the Zurich branch of the party, which doubled its electoral strength under his leadership, cannily exploiting the presence of German-language television in the city. Two years later, he entered the national parliament, where he also had a considerable impact. His rise showed how the declining importance of agriculture was forcing the SVP to find a new, more confrontational, role.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-3300"><img src="../images/00053.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">8.4 </span>The image of Christoph Blocher with which most Swiss will be familiar. The photograph shows him engaged in his powerful oratory, making much use of emphatic body language. He is flanked by Tony Brunner, a St Gallen farmer who replaced Ueli Maurer as party president a few years ago. Behind them is the party’s jokey logo, involving a cheery sun appearing over the initials of the party (Swiss People’s Party in German and Centre Democratic Union in French and Italian) and the ever present Swiss flag. The picture is symbolic of the party’s powerful and populist image, which has developed since the conflict over the EEA in the early 1990s.</div>
<p class="calibre4">The party both reinforced and benefited from the swing to the right, both in votations like that on maternity assurance and on policies which might hinder economic recovery, like extra training <a id="page_248" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>levies and taxes on energy consumption. The rise of the new SVP corresponded to a change in tone of foreign affairs, which became more open to European business and more hostile to the East. Thus the Swiss condemned the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and a rise in Eastern economic espionage, while holding back on contacts with the USSR. The ‘New Freeze’ of the early 1980s also revived the Swiss preference for armed neutrality . However, the Federal Council did move towards an application for UN entry, while the arrival of détente led some Swiss to question the value and virtue of the traditional armed forces, which consumed a disproportionate share of the national budget.</p>
<a id="page_249" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4"> To some extent the new tone also reflected the way that the economy finally recovered after the second oil shock. The new recession this produced continued unabated into 1982, after which growth resumed, first sluggishly and then more vigorously. Exports recovered well, especially in manufactures like chemicals , where mergers became the order of the day. The big banks also began to expand internationally on a much greater scale. Even the watch industry began to revive after several leading companies were merged into a new holding company, SMH, in 1983. The launch that year of the Swatch fun watch allowed the Swiss to start recovering market share, first in Europe and then even in Japan. New designs, quartz technology and better promotion were enforced by Nicholas Hayek, head of the new company. Only the engineering sector experienced continuing difficulty: Sulzer and others had to reduce their labour forces, and Brown-Boverei was eventually forced to merge with the Swedish ASEA combine. Recession followed by recovery did bring down inflation by half. Unemployment also fell by 60 per cent between 1984 and 1988, even though the number of foreign workers began to creep up again. Renewed immigration helped to control wages, even though demand and profits rose. So good did things seem to be that in some years the OECD ’s regular economic reports forbore to offer the Swiss any advice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Economic growth did add to social tensions by drawing in more people from Portugal, Yugoslavia and further afield who sought to better their lot by taking up new posts in construction and in hotels. The foreign population rose again from 14 per cent in the late 1970s to 18 per cent by 1990, at a time when the native birth rate was falling and the divorce rate rising. In contrast to the by now well-assimilated Italians and even the wave of Tamil refugees, traditionalists saw the new immigrants as more criminal and more alien to Swiss values. Renewed growth also heightened emerging problems of drug abuse and the linked problem of AIDS transmission among heroin users, which made itself felt after 1983. Indeed Switzerland, perhaps because of its affluence and well-developed counter-culture, became a major sufferer in the early AIDS epidemic. These trends all strengthened traditionalist unease.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, as with the earlier shift to the left, the swing to the right was never wholehearted or unchallenged. Thus, the electorate in 1982 <a id="page_250" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>accepted a popular initiative to reimpose the price controls that had lapsed in 1978. Indeed, the <span class="italic">Economist</span> in 1986 accused the country of putting up a ‘do not disturb’ sign in face of the neo-liberal revolution. This accusation was at odds with favourable foreign assessments of the continuing <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> by Peter Katzenstein and others. He admired the way the country had coped with the economic crises of the 1970s through its liberal corporatism, compensating market losses by domestic social provisions and cartelization. Swiss social welfare was also praised for avoiding welfare dependency and attacking poverty directly, rather than providing guarantees. The limited size of the Swiss government and its preference for subsidiarity, with matters handled locally when possible, also appealed to many.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Towards the end of the 1980s, it seemed as though the tide might turn once again, with the new forces liberated by 1968 again challenging the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span>. Even while the Social Democrats continued to lose votes in cantonal elections, despite their move to the centre, the ‘Group for a Switzerland without an Army’ – a youthful and radical social movement led by the charismatic Andi Gross and others – horrified the right and many other patriotic Swiss in 1985 by launching an initiative to abolish the army. This coincided with a new surge of environmental concern, the so-called <span class="italic">Grüne Welle</span>, which called for curbs on vehicular emissions and traffic flows. A 1987 referendum provided special protection for sensitive marshy areas, while more support came to railways and public transit through the Rail 2000 programme and after. Polls suggested that environmental concerns were the greatest worry facing the Swiss; these concerns were increasingly marshalled by the new Grüne Partei der Schweiz/Parti écologiste Suisse, which was formally established in 1986 and began to win cantonal seats. Mainstream parties had to take this on board, even on the far right, where a new secession from the N A took on an environmentalist colouring and won one national and forty-four cantonal seats.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The new forces faced a rival mobilization of conservative forces, however, motivated above all by threats to national sovereignty . The right saw Foreign Minister Pierre Aubert ’s efforts to move the country towards international cooperation through involvement in international organizations as a challenge to the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> . They succeeded in turning the electorate against such moves, leading to <a id="page_251" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>the rejection not merely of the Council of Europe ’s Social Charter and membership in UNESCO, but more significantly a crushing vote against the government’s proposal that Switzerland should at last become a full member of the UN. In March 1986, the proposal lost by 76 per cent–24 per cent on a relatively high turn-out of 50.7 per cent, showing that the hedgehog complex was still deeply rooted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While the defeat was partly due to poor government campaigning, it owed much more to the efforts of a new populist pressure group, Action for an Independent and Neutral Switzerland (AUNS/ASIN), led by Blocher, who was viscerally opposed to Swiss entanglements that might constrain its independence and neutrality . Blocher’s leadership of the AUNS/ASIN represented a move away from traditional parliamentary politics for him, and one that gave him a real boost by undermining the existing far right while showing that populist politics could deliver massive blows to the establishment. The vote also showed a real gulf opening up between inward-looking traditionalists, often rurally based, and more progressive, outward-looking and often urban groups. Although many thought the SVP might lose many seats to the Greens, including in the Federal Council , as a result of the 1987 elections, this did not happen. In fact, voters rallied to keep the SVP at 11 per cent while the Christian Democratic Party lost 4 per cent, starting what was to be a longer-term decline; the Greens made only modest gains, far removed from the expected breakthrough. However, the Green Party did win seats and began to penetrate cantonal politics, which encouraged new thinking on energy and toxic waste. The FDP and the SVP were also moved in 1988–9 to persuade Parliament to compensate the promoters of Kaiseraugst , since it was clear that building a new plant was now politically impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With the initial free-trade agreements now fully in force, Switzerland faced new and growing Europe an challenges. Along with the other EFTA states, Switzerland wanted to go further in cooperation, aware that the way the Community was enlarging and deepening would reduce EFTA’s influence. The Swiss thought they might share in decision-making that affected them through the 1984 Luxembourg Agreement, but this mechanism proved to be too restricted in scope. It was soon left behind, moreover, by the renewed development of <a id="page_252" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>the Community under the Single European Act and the potentially dynamic effects of the ‘1992 Single Market Programme’ . At Interlaken in 1987, the EC rejected the very idea of shared decision-making with third countries, making it clear that Switzerland was not a ‘quasi-member’, as some Swiss officials liked to think. A government report in August 1988 still looked to develop the ‘third way’, and averred that only if this did not work might membership become a possibility. Foreign policy problems outside Europe, notably over South Africa, also threatened to isolate Switzerland again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A greater crisis began in late 1988, after which Elizabeth Kopp was forced to resign, only days after being elected vice-president. Her resignation followed her reluctant admission that she had tipped off her colourful husband Hans about an investigation by her department of his firm, Shakarchi AG, over its part in handling the largest-ever case of laundered drug money. Although she at first denied any offence, further claims that the department had hindered other inquiries forced her to offer to resign at the end of February. Inquiries set in motion by the government soon produced evidence of breaches of confidentiality, and of misleading the Federal Council , forcing her to resign immediately. Her parliamentary immunity was suspended to allow for criminal prosecution. In the end she was acquitted on a legal technicality in the spring of 1990, but this was a pyrrhic victory for her and the establishment. A parliamentary commission of inquiry had revealed that there had been serious shortcomings in the administration of both departments. More importantly, it became apparent that the departments had, along with the Defence Ministry, been keeping some 900,000 secret files on alleged subversives that were full of hearsay and unreliable information. This revelation was linked to the continuing existence of P26. The ‘affair of the fiches’ became a major issue in the early 1990s, raising questions about public trust in the system, something that the looming vote on the abolition of the army threatened to reinforce.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In other words, if, by the end of the 1980s, the country had been transformed economically and socially, it was not problem-free. Fissures were in fact appearing in the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> . If prosperity and social harmony remained largely untouched, the political and diplomatic pillars of the Sonderfall were being opened up by new developments inside and outside Switzerland. Evidently, not all the country’s <a id="page_253" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>policy problems had been successfully solved either. Deepening arguments about economic policy, European relations, foreigners , forests, and the role of army and state were all to help undermine the Sonderfal l in the coming years, just as Switzerland found itself in a very changed international situation.</p>
