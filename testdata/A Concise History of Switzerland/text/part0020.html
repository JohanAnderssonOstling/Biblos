<p class="noindent">The breaching of the Berlin Wall and the ensuing collapse of the Soviet empire ushered the Swiss into a new era, even if they were not always aware of it. Alterations in the context on which the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> rested and developing resistance to change began to turn the fissures in the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> into large cracks. The country found itself forced to rethink its armed neutrality , to cope with a surge in asylum applications and to devise new relations with a changing EU , all at a time of economic depression and painful scrutiny of the country’s Second World War record. These challenges stimulated a populist nationalist response, much like that found in other European countries. It was led by the Swiss People’s Party (SVP), which was opposed to international entanglements, whether with the Un ited Nations or the EU, on the grounds of their incompatibility with the Sonderfall. The rise of populist nationalism led to government crises and controversial votations and elections that posed questions about the country’s future direction. Increasingly, the country faced a choice between adapting to outside demands or resisting change and maintaining the Sonderfall. Politics, in other words, became increasingly polarized and sometimes personalized.</p>
<p class="calibre4">All this put the system, and especially the government, under great pressure as it tried to navigate between the rocks of outside problems and the shoals of shifting domestic opinion. As a result, all the elements of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> were threatened: the country’s foreign policy stance, its prosperity, its cohesion, its consensus politics, its policy successes and its memories of its role in the Second World <a id="page_255" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>War, along with its sense of identity . For some time, the populist response to these threats looked like fundamentally challenging the whole Swiss post-war system, but consensus reasserted itself often enough to prevent this, though it still left the country divided and uncertain. And, while such reverses as the country suffered were slight in comparison to problems elsewhere, they were still sufficient to worry the Swiss. In this, Switzerland became a more normal state, evolving in much the same way as its Europe an neighbours.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-3359"><span class="title">A Changed International Position</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">For most Europeans, 1989 means the end of the Cold War , but this was not always the case in Switzerland, given that debates over the army, the fate of the first women Federal Councillor and secret files were all over the front pages that year. Indeed, perhaps because of concern with the Kopp scandal, the attack on the army and a controversial exhibition called ‘Diamant ’ celebrating the anniversary of 1939, the Swiss government itself did not immediately appreciate the significance of the fall of the Berlin Wall , first telling journalists that it could not comment on every little international event and eventually admitting that it had been taken by surprise. The fact that the Swiss ambassador in Berlin was twice arrested for drunkenness at the time did not help. The country thus limped along after everyone else, even though the collapse of the Soviet satellites necessarily affected its international strategies.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In fact, the end of the Cold War immediately transformed the debate on the army. Although the Group for a Switzerland without an Army lost the votation in late November 1989, the fact that over a third of voters voted in favour of abolishing the army, despite a massive counter campaign, was a real warning shot across the establishment’s bows. Public opinion was also shaken by finding that, after the 1990 agreement between Helmut Kohl and Mikhail Gorbachev on reducing the size of the Bundeswehr in return for allowing German reunification, the Swiss army – potentially 650,000 militia men strong – was nominally the largest in Europe, an odd position for a pacific neutral country.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The government responded by initiating a programme of military reform, known as Army 95 : limiting the army to 370,000, cutting the <a id="page_256" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>length of time served and abolishing some reserve formations. Such changes fell far short of satisfying the army’s critics, who successfully pushed for a civilian alternative to military service, and unsuccessfully for rejecting the purchase of 34 F/A18 jet fighters . However, a second attempt to abolish the army was crushingly defeated in 2001, although criticisms and changes still worried traditionalist defenders of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span>, who disliked any move away from a wholly militia army.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The authorities also had to move on neutrality and foreign policy , since Switzerland could no longer claim to be a buffer state between West and East. Instead it found itself in the middle of a sea of peaceable democratic states with nobody to be neutral between. Not only was there less demand for Swiss services as an honest broker but there was also more competition to provide such services. Moreover, in order to uphold international law, the government in 1990 imposed sanctions on Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait. The contemporaneous implosion of the Neutral and Non-Aligned Group left the country even more isolated and uncertain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since critics believed that neutrality also prevented closer relations with the EU , which the government wanted, an expert study group was set up. Its 1992 report argued that neutrality should be seen with a clearer eye and in a new Europe an context, no longer as a barrier to EU entry . Until a fully fledged system of European collective security emerged, and neutrality could be relinquished, Switzerland should maintain an independent defence capacity but should also show more openness and solidarity by integrating further into Europe. Like many in the foreign policy establishment, the Group believed that Swiss independence and freedom of action could only be maintained by taking part in international institutions. As with changes to the army, this belief was rejected by traditionalists, adding to their unease and turning neutrality into a source of unsettling internal debate rather than a firm pillar of a Sonderfall .</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-3381"><img src="../images/00054.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">9.1 </span>The new Gotthard railway tunnel. The picture shows workers in the Gotthard base tunnel celebrating the breakthrough in the eastern bore on 15 October 2010, waving Swiss, Italian and Ticinese flags amongst others. They are pictured standing in front of the cutting face of a tunnel boring machine, which had come from the north. The project was implemented mainly to relieve Switzerland of the pollution caused by excessive lorry traffic through the (surprisingly fragile) Alps. Agreed in 1992, construction started in 1996 and full service is scheduled for 2017.</div>
<p class="calibre4">When in January 1989, Commission President Jacques Delors talked about a new deal with all the EFTA countries, involving shared decision-making, it seemed for a moment as though things were working out on relations with Europe. The Swiss leaped for joy and joined in negotiations with the other EFTA states. Unfortunately, these proved to be very difficult; Austria and Sweden ultimately applied <a id="page_257" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>for entry because they felt the likely benefits of the proposed deal were too limited. Switzerland’s sensitive position in European transit also proved an obstacle, since the Swiss objected – on environmental grounds – to excessive lorry movement through the Alps. Ultimately, the government proposed building and financing new base rail tunnels as compensation for imposing new charges on trans-Alpine truck transit. In the end, agreement on what was to become the European Economic Area was reached on the night of 21–2 October 1991, but the two French-speaking Swiss ministers negotiating coupled their acceptance of the deal with the comment that it was incompatible with Swiss interests and dignity, a stance that was to haunt the government .</p>
<a id="page_258" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">A major political crisis broke out in 1992 when doubts about new external initiatives came home to roost, against a background of political change and growing challenges to the establishment. The <span class="italic">Fichenskandal</span> continued to cause enormous uproar and forced a parliamentary inquiry. Three hundred thousand people demanded to see their files, and it became almost a symbol of pride to have had a file. The affair left a very nasty taste in many people’s mouths, shaking their confidence in the institutions on which the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> rested. Alarm also grew over the quintupling of applications for asylum between the late 1980s and 1991, owing to instability in Turkey and Sri Lanka. The processing system was overwhelmed, and the numbers of resident foreigners rose from just under a million in 1985 to nearly a million and a half by 1995, or over 20 per cent of the population. The far right increasingly seized on these numbers, claiming that asylum seekers were flooding the country (even though only a minority of applications were actually successful). In response, the government tried to restrict migration by introducing a three-circles policy in 1991. This allowed considerable free movement to people from European states and relatively generous access for people from other white western states, but imposed severe restrictions on applications from the rest of the world. Nevertheless, as elsewhere, the issue produced a new wave of ethnic and national ist feeling in Switzerland, which affected domestic as well as diplomatic matters. Notably, this surge increasingly overwhelmed the influence of the new social movements that had been so visible in the 1980s.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-3392"><span class="title">European and Economic Worries</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The new national populism showed itself most strongly in the 1992 votation on the EEA, and was strengthened by reactions to the first real recession that post-war Switzerland had known. Economic pressure in turn reinforced emerging social problems at odds with the Sonderfall image. At the same time, the very foundation of the Sonderfall, the country’s Second World War record, also came under vigorous outside attack. Still, the tenacity of traditionalism had already showed itself in another rejection of VAT in 1990. In the 1991 general election, the first when votes at 18 were allowed, the small parties of the far right, including a new formation, the populist <a id="page_259" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Lega dei Ticinesi , did well, whereas Radicals and Christian Democrats both lost heavily. All told the far right won 11 per cent of the vote, nearly twice as many as the Greens , showing how radicalism and change were encouraging support for defenders of <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall Schweiz</a></span>. Nonetheless, the Greens did make a modest breakthrough, symbolizing different doubts about the direction in which Switzerland was heading. The Federal Tribunal in 1990 also ruled against the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3728">Landsgemeinde</a></span> of Appenzell Inner Rhoden , which refused to allow female participation, finally ending electoral exclusion – if not all discrimination against women – across Switzerland. This helped to pave the way for an upsurge in women’s presence and participation in society.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Left-wing and intellectual opposition lay behind the lukewarm celebration of the Confederation ’s 700th Anniversary in 1991. In fact, the idea of having any festivities was contested on both historical and contemporary grounds. For some intellectuals, a century of a ‘snooper’ state, and even 700 years of any national history, was more than enough. However, much public opinion and the leadership of the SVP disregarded such critical views, still adhering to the liberation myth , including the reality of Tell . One of the key events of the festivities was a seminar on whether Switzerland was still a <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span>. The term began to fall out of use after 1989, reflecting the way in which the Kopp affair and the files scandal had damaged the idea of Switzerland as an exceptional model democracy. Indeed, Foreign Minister Réné Felber was quoted as saying he never wanted to hear the term again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The growing internal divide over armed neutrality and the lack of faith in the system came to a head over closer relations with the EC. Encouraged by the first opinion poll to show a majority in favour of joining the EC, and then by public approval in early May 1992 of Swiss entry to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the government decided to apply for entry later that month. But by then, the ECJ had reduced the independence of the EEA, and Norway and Finland had also applied for entry. The Swiss application confused many voters and left the government – whose campaigning was poor and not supported by business – exposed to the charge that it was asking the electorate to vote for a step that it felt was flawed. The charge was brilliantly exploited by AUNS under Blocher , which <a id="page_260" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_261" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>depicted staying out as cost free, whereas entry would threaten prosperity, cohesion and independence . Such arguments mobilized many habitual non-voters, increasingly distrustful of government, so that the turnout was an unprecedented 78.3 per cent. Entry was rejected by 50.3 per cent to 49.7 per cent, but with only seven cantons , mainly French-speaking, in favour. Described by some Ministers as ‘a black day’, the vote was initially interpreted as revealing a linguistic problem, as there was immense unhappiness in the Suisse Romande . Many French -speakers felt, not wholly accurately, that their interests had again been trampled under foot by the German -speaking majority, even going to the extent of raising mock customs barriers along the language frontier. Such hostility led to a good deal of parliamentary soul-searching and eventually to a new constitutional article on languages in 1996.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-3424"><img src="../images/00055.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">9.2 </span>Populist campaigns. The poster calls on the Swiss to reject entry to the European Economic Area in the votation of 6 December 1992. The EEA (or Espace Economique Européenne as it was then known) is depicted as an imposition that would prevent the country from seeing where it was going, thus depriving it of its freedom. Published by a small magazine in French-speaking Switzerland, the poster sums up the views of the successful traditionalist opposition, led by AUNS and the SVP. The votation, which rejected entry, was a key moment in recent Swiss politics and policy.</div>
<p class="calibre4">In fact, the EEA vote was much more a symbol of a new divide between an outward-looking, mainly urban Switzerland and a more inward-looking, mainly rural Switzerland which was losing its confidence in government and doubtful about new policies on neutrality and foreigners . The government was forced to freeze the membership application and reduce its <span class="italic">Eurolex</span> legislative adaption programme, which became known as <span class="italic">Swisslex</span>. In 1994 lorry transit across the Alps became an additional complication thanks to a restrictive popular initiative. The government also found itself facing a newly energized and restructured nationalist right, of which, following the 6 December 1992 votation , Christoph Blocher had became the acknowledged symbol and leader. His Zurich wing of the SVP became increasingly influential, combative and anti-establishment, winning over the conservatively inclined. It won its first new seats for years in 1995, mainly at the expense of the Swiss Democrats, even though the Social Democrats did even better, becoming once more the largest party in the National Council. The SPS also succeeded in getting a second woman into the Cabinet in 1993 when Ruth Dreifuss , nominally from Geneva, was chosen after a male candidate was preferred over the party’s original female choice. He felt it wise to refuse election, given the immense feminist pressure, leaving the way open for Dreifuss to take the seat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The success of both SPS and SVP reflected the fact that the country was experiencing its first real depression since 1945. Starting in 1991 <a id="page_262" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>and continuing until 1997, the economy contracted 2 per cent as trade and demand fell, owing to downturns elsewhere in Europe, the deflationary policy of the National Bank and a continuation of the low rate of economic growth experienced in the past. The depression triggered a certain amount of deregulation and the beginnings of shareholder activism. There was also a good deal of consolidation, notably in chemicals, retailing and banks, where in 1998, SBC from Basle merged with the Union Bank from Zurich, forming the new UBS bank. Fewer of those working were independent, while more and more became employees, often for the sixty-six largest firms. Some 200,000 jobs were lost, leading to 5.5 per cent unemployment , a twenty-fold increase over the 1990s, even if less than elsewhere. Moreover, real wages fell as inflation rose above the European average. As a result, wealth became increasingly redistributed to the benefit of the rich, with the number of millionaires rising precipitously, even while as many as one in six Swiss was classified as working poor . Not surprisingly, there was a sharp rise in the number of strikes , notably in 1993–4 and again in 1997–9, along with increasing invalidity insurance claims. Equally, the depression helped to produce an unprecedented expansion in social spending on unemployment and pensions, along with the consolidation of the welfare state. As another pillar of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> eroded, a major debate on economic policy started: neo-liberals like David de Pury and other leading industrialists called in their 1995 White Book for a radical reorganization, deregulation and privatization of the economy and, especially, of the welfare state. Its costs were already seen as responsible for declining competitiveness. The left was vociferous in its rejection, and called for more regulation. Generally liberalization was unpopular, even though Blocher, in contradistinction to many of his new supporters, was in favour of freeing the economy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The depression also threatened social cohesion and harmony as levels of violent crime began to creep up, along with divorce and suicide rates. Many Swiss also found the escalating costs of medical insurance premiums a major burden. These developments led many, especially blue-collar workers, to respond to the appeal of the SVP, turning away from the trade unions, who were finding it increasingly difficult to deal with more aggressive and better-organized employers. To an extent, such voters accepted the SVP argument that part of <a id="page_263" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>the problem was caused by asylum seekers. The SVP fanned discontent with a failed popular attempt to curb clandestine immigration in December 1996.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The party was also helped by a head-on challenge to the foundation of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> , Switzerland’s role in the Second World War . In 1995, encouraged by Edgar Bronfman, head of the revived World Jewish Congress, survivors and their lawyers used the US courts to launch a class action against Swiss banks for refusing to release dormant accounts originating with victims of the Holocaust. The case was taken up by Senator Alfonse d’Amato and US Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, who issued a report drawn from the archives. The accusations against Switzerland soon broadened out to embrace claims that it had collaborated in the Holocaust by accepting gold from concentration camps (or looted from occupied states) and refused Jewis h refugees entry, not to mention prolonging the war by its economic assistance to the Nazis. The temperature was raised by accusatory books, which proposed boycotts of Swiss goods.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Aware that they could be heavily penalized if they did not cooperate, the banks agreed in August 1998 to pay $1.3 billion in compensation, a sum boosted by contributions from insurance firms and manufacturers whose German subsidiaries had used forced labour during the war. The Swiss government had felt it necessary in 1995 both to apologize for its wartime treatment of refugees and to sponsor an assessment of the dormant accounts issue and an international historical commission – led by economic historian Jean-Francois Bergier – to investigate Switzerland’s behaviour in the war. It also offered to create a $5 billion general Solidarity Fund for victims of distress. The Bergier Commission produced a host of studies and two reports, one in December 1999 and a final one in March 2002. It found that Switzerland had been restrictive in its treatment of refugees and in its response to the needs of the time. It also accepted that anti-Semitism had affected Swiss behaviour, and that neutrality had been biased towards Germany. However, many of the more extreme criticisms were shown to have been exaggerated. In any case, the American Volcker Committee found that, contrary to earlier claims, Swiss banks held 54,000 accounts that may have belonged to victims of the Holocaust , along with 25,000 other relevant accounts. <a id="page_264" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Repayments soon began, but this still left many questions pending, such as the economy and Europe.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-3462"><span class="title">The Sonderfall Strikes Back</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The criticisms of the country’s behaviour between 1939 and 1945, whether from inside Switzerland or abroad, were bitterly resented by many Swiss who had endured the difficult wartime years and who refused to be transformed from heroes into villains. Their memory, which was the ultimate source of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span>, was offended, and their fears for national institutions and identity carried over into resistance to European integration . On both topics Blocher and the SVP spoke for them, denigrating Bergier and his methods and providing a ‘clarification’ that played up Swiss successes and the country’s need for access to neighbouring states during the war so as to ensure its survival. Blocher even called for a ‘war’ against the United States, believing that Switzerland was being unfairly ‘lynched’ and that the government had given in to blackmail. Not surprisingly, the electorate in 2002 rejected the financing suggested for the proposed Solidarity Fund, showing that the Swiss were still having difficulty in facing up to their wartime past. As a result, the affair deepened the emerging rift between inward-looking Swiss and the non-SVP parts of the establishment. The former were particularly alarmed that the latter did not stand up for traditional Swiss rights and identity . This reflected the way in which, while European elites continued with attempts at international cooperation, in Switzerland as elsewhere, a significant part of society and politics reverted to more old-fashioned national thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This rift revealed itself in a new initiative to limit the foreign population to 18 per cent of the total population. Although this was decisively rejected, two years later the SVP enjoyed what it called a ‘triumphant’ defeat when its initiative against abuse of the asylum system failed by only 1.2 per cent. The outcome reflected a renewed surge of asylum seekers produced by the bitter wars in the former Yugoslavia, which often overwhelmed facilities and produced a number of attacks, often violent, on foreigners . The votation also reinforced the SVP’s belief in direct democracy as its ultimate political and populist weapon. The initiative process became more a right-wing <a id="page_265" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>bludgeon than a left-wing goad. In fact, six of the eighteen initiatives that have been successful since 1891 were accepted between 2000 and 2010. The SVP’s new approach transformed Swiss politics, making these more aggressive, more personalized, more polarized and more media-dominated. Rather than involving discreet pragmatic cooperation and consultation, Swiss politics increasingly involved almost permanent campaigning and electioneering.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Traditionalist national populism also showed up in hostile attitudes towards European integration , which was seen as threatening sovereignty and self-reliance. The authorities consistently underestimated such sentiments as they pressed ahead with bilateral negotiations to fill the gap left by Switzerland’s absence from the EEA. Negotiations proved immensely difficult, especially after the electorate voted in 1994 for the Alpine initiative, which required a dramatic transfer of trans-Alp ine traffic from road to rail. In the event, an agreement was finalized only in June 1999, after the public backed related financial proposals. The agreement consisted of a phased package deal, tied together by what was called a guillotine clause, which meant that if the Swiss rejected any element, then all would fall. This approach testified to Brussels’s awareness of the power of Swiss direct democracy . For the Swiss, the significant elements of the package included transport and especially the free movement of labour. The Swiss gave up their ban on lorries over 28 tonnes and lowered transit taxes in return for acceptance of the principle of charging EU vehicles to use the roads. The deal also allowed Swiss airlines free access to EU air space with rights of cabotage, the lack of which had been undermining Swissair. Free movement was even more controversial. It was to be phased in with a review in 2009. Switzerland was also allowed flanking measures to protect against what was called ‘social dumping’ (paying EU workers in Switzerland at lower EU rates). Such worries led the Swiss Democrats and the Lega Ticinese to challenge the deal, forcing a referendum. With the SVP nominally neutral, the unions won over by flanking measures and the business community actively in favour, the whole deal was approved in May 2000 by a two-to-one majority.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The challenge was nevertheless a sign that the citizenry was getting worried about Swiss identity as well as the economy. This had already been visible in controversies over the celebration of Swiss <a id="page_266" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a> confederalism in 1998. The establishment planned to celebrate 1848, but the Latin cantons believed this overlooked 1798, the more significant (for them) bicentenary of their freedom from ‘colonial oppression’. Language questions also underlay arguments about the growing use of English in academia, business and, from 2000, schools, where some German-speaking cantons sought to make it the first foreign language , ahead of French and Italian, causing alarm in Latin Switzerland. The SVP took the opportunity to appeal more vigorously to more traditional nationalist narratives of Swiss history , and to rebut the critical views found in the modern historiography favoured by the establishment, whether on the longer-term past or, especially, where the Second World War was concerned. Such <a id="page_267" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>historical traditionalism reinforced inward-looking attitudes and resistance to change. Hence, despite the way the cantons were rewriting their own constitutions, there was little enthusiasm, and some opposition, to the modernization of the national constitution . A draft was put out to consultation in 1995, and a revised version was submitted to Parliament in 1998. This produced a final text later that year, which was approved in April 1999. Significantly however, only 36 per cent of the electorate bothered to turn out, while some conservative voices remained vehemently opposed.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-3497"><img src="../images/00056.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">9.3 </span>The annual Landsgemeinde of canton Glarus, one of only two remaining in Switzerland. The assembly meets on a Sunday in early May in the Glarus town’s Zaunplatz beneath the Glärnisch mountain and attracts up to 7,000 people. Of late the authorities have erected a temporary wooden ring of raised terraces on which citizens can stand to get a view of the authorities on the central dais. The meeting, which can last eight hours, discusses all kinds of political issues, with voting carried out by raising a yellow card.</div>
<p class="calibre4">The new draft was shorter, better organized and more rights-oriented than its predecessor. It also encouraged further revision of cantonal constitutions. Thus, the people of Obwalden abolished their <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3728">Landsgemeinde</a></span> in 1998, leaving only Glarus and Appenzell Inner Rhoden with public mass decision-making. Federalism also encouraged increasing consolidation of small communes , so that by 2011 there were only 2,500 compared to the 3,000-plus of the 1980s. In Glarus, two dozen communes were reduced to only three. New legislation also rearranged the distribution of tasks and funding between the cantons and the Confederation , and also amongst the cantons . The latter began to play a larger role as a corporate body, notably through the conferences of cantonal ministers, especially the Conference of Governments set up in 1993 and the House of Cantons in Berne. The cantons used their new rights to challenge legislation for the first time in 2004, as well as appointing permanent representatives in the capital to lobby and protect their interests. Talk of reuniting the Basle s and creating a new super-canton in the Jura hills seem likely to remain unfulfilled, to judge by the failure of an attempt to merge Vaud and Geneva. However, it is possible that the existing canton of Jura may succeed in expanding southwards.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The federal element of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> was also affected by the way that politics was becoming increasingly nationa l. In the 1999 parliamentary elections, the SVP made an unprecedented breakthrough by winning an additional fifteen seats, taking its strength to forty-four and making it the second largest formation in the Lower House. Moreover, it polled the same percentage of the electorate as the Social Democrats and won two seats in the Upper House . Its gains came mainly at the expense of the small far-right groups, notably the <a id="page_268" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Autopartei (now rebranded as the Freedom Party), and some of its victories were in those German-speaking cantons where a few years before it had had no representation. The SVP won despite a recovering economy and a fall in the numbers of unemployed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although it was not able to win extra seats in cantonal executives or the Federal Council , the party was clearly on the move. It continued to build on its gains, alarming the mainstream parties and liberal public opinion and dividing the country as it did so. Increasingly it followed the line of other Western Europe an populist movements, painting the native majority as the new minority, ‘victimized’ by foreigners , by an untrustworthy political elite and by the left. The party blamed the post-1968 left for most of Switzerland’s problems. However, despite using the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> as a political weapon and despite its claim that the Bergier Report had been interested only in cataloguing Swiss offences, the party was unable to change all the policies it disliked, such as further reform of the army . Nor could it prevent either the Federal Council issuing a critical report on Swiss relations with South Africa during the apartheid years or, in 2002, the electorate’s very narrow approval of UN entry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The party was more successful on the European front. The government was again embarrassed in 2001 when it failed to get the New Swiss European Movement (NEBS/NOMES), the pro-European lobby, to withdraw an initiative calling for immediate entry negotiations. Because it knew that the time was not ripe, the establishment urged people to vote the initiative down, which they did massively. This was wrongly seen as a formal rejection of the whole principle of entry. In any case the government pressed on with a second round of bilateral negotiations . Progress on technical issues was rapid, but the process was bedevilled by Swiss refusal of automatic exchanges of information on foreigners’ bank accounts, on grounds of banking secrecy. Access to the Schengen system of free movement also became an issue; Switzerland sought access to the system because this would remove the danger that tourists might be put off if they had to obtain a special visa for Switzerland when visiting EU countries, or that the country would be targeted by would-be asylum seekers. In the end, in 2003, the EU agreed to allow Switzerland and other states to retain bank confidentiality in return for a withholding tax, three-quarters <a id="page_269" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>of which would be passed to relevant EU states. The Swiss negotiating position was constrained by SVP opposition, which carried increasing weight because of the party’s electoral progress. At the cantonal level it gained 150 seats between 1995 and 2003, when it also made a further eleven national gains, many of them in the Suisse Romande, reinforcing the nationalization of politics. While the SVP increased its share of the vote to 26 per cent and the Social Democrats held their own, the Radicals and Christian Democrats both lost heavily. In other words, the Sonderfall was not giving up the fight.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-3535"><span class="title">Polarization</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The increasing challenge from the SVP and its supporters was powerful but not uniformly popular. Although other parties and forces lacked its solid support and resources, they did their best to resist and on occasions scored some surprising victories. All this meant that politics became increasingly polarized between the hard-line Zurich wing of the SVP on the one hand, and, on the other, a progressive alliance of Social Democrats and many Greens. This was not just a left–right divide, it was also a divide between outward-looking winners from globalization and inward-looking losers who opposed it. Hence, many workers switched between the Social Democrats and the SVP, with the result that policy-making became more difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Changing voting patterns, in other words, reflected a new and more divisive politics: people increasingly voted on their values and not their socio-economic interest, making compromise more difficult. Unsettled by globalization with its encouragement of multinational enterprises and with growing economic pressure on Swiss farms – whose numbers fell by a third between 1990 and 2010 – and with the increasing inequality it promoted, many saw themselves as losing out in terms of crime , welfare and language. They were also aware that although income inequalities were growing, as was happening throughout the western world, they were not benefiting. A series of accidents that called into question the country’s reputation for quiet efficiency and policy success involved with the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> may also have made voters look for new reassurance. The closure of the Gotthard auto tunnel after a fire, the grounding, merger and forced sale of Swissair in 2001–2, the massacre in the Zug cantonal <a id="page_270" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>parliament in September 2001, the Uberlingen air crash of July 2002 and troubles over the 2002 Expo in the western lakes (from which Swiss flags were supposed to be banned), helped to increase doubts at home and abroad whether Switzerland was as reliable a mode l as it had been. The <span class="italic">amour propre</span> of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> seemed to be in danger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Many worried voters were attracted by the SVP’s clearly focused message on identitarian themes, whereas the SPS drew less on workers and more on middle-class voters who gained from the gathering Europeanization , which continued despite popular opposition to political links with the EU. The confluence of cultural issues with rapid change made the open/shut divide, and general polarization , almost more acute than in other European countries. This was reflected in increasing politicization, which saw higher turnouts (especially amongst the elderly, whose views were marked by the war years), more petitions and even rising party membership. The SVP both encouraged and profited from all these trends, creating a mass populist party just as similar parties in other countries were running into difficulties. The party was unique in Swiss terms as well. It was media-savvy, well-funded, well-organized and led not just by Blocher , but also by a new generation of highly committed and charismatic MPs, often more inflammatory (and French-speaking ) than Blocher himself, and equally capable of dominating television arenas and the columns of the popular press. The other parties found it virtually impossible to compete with the SVP, allowing the party to set the political weather.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With all this going for it, immediately after the 2003 elections the SVP demanded the second seat in government it felt had been denied it in 1999, refusing to accept any other candidate than Blocher. He was eventually elected in place of Ruth Metzler , the first time an unblemished sitting minister had been set aside since 1874. Since Hans-Rudolf Merz , a conservative Radical, was also elected, the balance of government was changed. Old consensual conventions about gender and cantonal representation, let alone the right of ministers to decide on the time of their own departure, were swept aside. Many MPs in other parties were distinctly unhappy with all this, but they learned the lesson and were to apply it four years later.</p>
<a id="page_271" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">The election of Blocher did not, as some had hoped, domesticate him; instead, the tone of government began to change. The Federal Council became increasingly politicized, since Blocher remained openly critical of the government and its policies, wading into things outside his remit and never missing a chance to promote his own and his party’s ideas. His supporters saw this as cleaning out the Augean stables of a corrupt elite, whereas critics saw it as undermining the system of collegial responsibility and ministerial solidarity that had been in effect for a century. The atmosphere got so bad that the majority censored Blocher in 2006 for some of his outbursts, and one minister stepped down early because of the uncomfortable atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nonetheless, the remaining checks and balances of the system meant that domestic policy did not change all that much, even though in 2004 Parliament , for the first time ever, turned down the government’s policy programme. The government was further embarrassed when the electorate agreed to an SVP-inspired initiative condemning those guilty of sexual crime s to perpetual imprisonment, since this was impossible to square with Europe an human rights law. Blocher did succeed in toughening asylum policy, as well, while the electorate in 2006 rejected government ideas on making naturalization easier for long-established young foreigners . The same year, however, the electorate heavily rejected an SVP challenge to new proposals on educational harmonization, and after nearly half a century, a maternity insurance plan was finally approved in 2004. This more or less completed the welfarization of the Swiss state. Nonetheless, the costs and complexities of the welfare state, as in other countries, were a constant source of argument and unease. As in other countries, the government also launched a programme of measures to help revitalize the still sluggish economy. Partial liberalization of the electricity market was achieved, while two new regulatory agencies, COMCO (for competition) and FINMA (for financial markets), were established.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The SVP also failed to prevent foreign policy from taking on a more international dimension; under the new Social Democratic foreign minister, Micheline Calmy-Rey , Switzerland played an active role in the United Nations and beyond, prompting the SVP to call for her resignation for breaching neutrality . The party’s opposition to <a id="page_272" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>closer links with Europe met with only limited success. In 2004 it failed to prevent either the negotiation of a second set of bilateral s (including entry to Schengen and a deal on savings) or the extension of the solidarity payments and rights of free movement to the ten states who then joined the EU. Nor could it force the government to take the symbolic step of withdrawing, rather then freezing, the 1992 application, something which led the party to promise a twenty-year war to prevent entry . However, the government did downgrade entry into the EU from its key aim to a mere option.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite some setbacks, the SVP also continued to prosper electorally, although growing at a slower rate than before. By 2007, it finished up for the first time as the largest party in cantonal parliaments. The Social Democrats steadily lost cantonal seats, and saw their cherished project for a single national health insurance scheme heavily defeated in 2006. They were also threatened by the advance of the Greens . In the centre, the Radicals found it hard not to be sucked into the SVP’s wake, although the Christian Democrats seemed to have started to reverse their long-term decline. The apparent slackening off in the SVP’s rate of expansion and the economic recovery – which saw growth rates of 3 per cent, increasing domestic demand and no rise in unemployment – suggested that the SVP would not make much progress in 2007. In fact, the party launched itself into the campaign with vigour, jointly focusing on Blocher and on its ‘Contract with the Swiss’. This committed the party to cutting taxes, deporting foreign criminals and staying out of the EU. This won it seven more seats, and a record 29 per cent of the popular vote, mostly at the expense of the SPS, which fell below 20 per cent, and to a lesser extent the Radicals , thereby enhancing polarization and leaving open the possibility of an SVP-led system change.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="c19444-3574"><span class="title">A Consensus Under Continuing Pressure</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">It was at this point that the consensus whirligig brought in its revenges, leading to Blocher’s eviction from the cabinet and a failed attempt by the SVP to go into ‘opposition’. Nonetheless, the party remained the agenda-setter, along with outside events. In fact, at the same time the Sonderfall was further undermined by the credit crunch and the related assaults on bank ing secrecy, while in the 2<a id="page_273" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>011 elections, the SVP’s onward advance was partly halted and its governmental ambitions reined in. The country thus remains uneasily poised politically between possible futures even though, comparatively speaking, its situation is an enviable one.</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-3578"><img src="../images/00057.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">9.4 </span>An official portrait of Mrs Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, Minister of Finance and President in 2012. However, in 2007 she became a hate object for the SVP after agreeing to accept nomination to government after the defeat of Christoph Blocher. She did this in order to ensure the party kept its second ministerial portfolio, but because she was both a moderate and the person who kept the party leader out of office, she was regarded as a traitor and forced out into a new party. Nonetheless, she successfully took over Blocher’s Justice and Police portfolio before moving to Finance.</div>
<p class="calibre4">In late 2007, just as it seemed as though the SVP was on the cusp of a real breakthrough, things rapidly changed. Voters moved to defend consensus, dealing the party several blows in the second round of the elections for the Council of States . Then, in the National Council , the Christian Democrats , Social Democrats and Greens copied the SVP’s 2003 tactics and worked together to eject Blocher from government, replacing him by Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, the respected SVP Finance Director in Grisons. Although Blocher’s ejection was carried out completely within the existing rules, the SVP was outraged and <a id="page_274" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>went into opposition. This proved to be ineffective, and remained limited to a mean-spirited attempt to expel Mrs Widmer-Schlumpf and her fellow moderate SVP minister, Samuel Schmid, from the party. This was done, but only at the cost of driving them and many other moderates out into a new Conservative Democratic party, the BDP/PBD. The SVP also found itself stymied in Parliament , being able to block policies only when it could find allies. Even when the party turned to direct democracy, it lost on initiatives about allowing secret local decisions on naturalizations, and on banning government campaigning during votations, while the act it supported on cutting business taxes only just scraped through. The party’s internal divisions and its U-turns on extending free movement to Bulgaria and Romania, which it completely failed to prevent, did not help it. Hence, the SVP eventually gave up insisting on Blocher’s return to the Federal Council and abandoned formal opposition. In consequence, it was just able to secure the election of Ueli Maurer to the Federal Council in December 2008, although once again a rogue SVP candidate pushed by the centre and left nearly claimed the seat. With five parties represented in government for the first time, many thought that consensus governance was at an end.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the event, however, party strife was overshadowed when the country got caught up in the credit crunch and the ensuing depression , which called the economic pillars of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> further into question. While the economy did relatively well in 2007–8, the summer of 2007 revealed major difficulties at UBS , the country’s biggest bank. This had expanded aggressively in the United States, abandoning traditional conservative Swiss approaches for rampant Anglo-American risk-taking and a heavy exposure to the emerging sub-prime mortgage crisis. UBS had to write down large sums and admit to large losses. Investors began to withdraw their funds, and its shares lost much of their value, leaving Credit Suisse as the largest Swiss bank. Chairman Marcel Ospel admitted defeat and stepped down in the spring of 2008, but the problems endured, especially as the Swiss were badly hit by Lehmann Brothers’ collapse. In October 2008 the government had to step in and follow Ireland in propping its banks up by taking a 9 per cent share in UBS and arranging for the National Bank to buy UBS’s toxic assets and put them in a new offshore ‘bad’ bank. After the bank had racked up the country’s <a id="page_275" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>greatest-ever corporate loss of 20 billion francs in 2008, a fresh management team was installed at UBS in spring 2009, and set about making large staff and service cuts.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The recession put the economy as a whole into negative growth, with bankruptcies and unemployment both rising, which forced the government to produce three stimulus packages. The effects of the downturn elsewhere also put Switzerland under new pressure because of its tax and banking policies. The EU took issue with low cantonal tax rates, pioneered by Zug , which it felt unfairly – and against the terms of the 1972 agreement – incited firms to leave their homelands for Swiss tax havens. The French also objected in particular to the special tax deals devised for people like the racing driver Michael Schumacher, especially when rock hero Johnny Hallyday decamped to Switzerland ahead of the French presidential election of 2007. Moreover, the EU did not feel it was getting sufficient returns from the withholding tax on income from holdings at Swiss banks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The OECD and the United States also assaulted banking secrecy and the role of Swiss banks in encouraging Americans to evade US tax obligations. The Americans were helped in this by the revelations of a UBS whistle-blower, Bradley Birkenfeld. Faced with the threat of being placed on an OECD blacklist, the government first allowed UBS to release 250 names of American clients to the US authorities, and then, in March 2009, agreed to relax the banking laws in line with OECD norms, accepting that tax evasion as well as tax fraud provided a legitimate reason for lifting bank secrecy. This change was written into the new dual-tax treaties needed to get Switzerland’s name removed from an existing OECD grey list. Such measures did not stop the United States from launching a suit against UBS, seeking access to 52,000 names of allegedly illicit American clients who had been attracted by UBS to take out confidential accounts in Switzerland. The government was forced to step in, and in August 2009 agreed to allow the American Internal Revenue Service full access to 4,450 accounts. In theory, this agreement preserved bank ing secrecy, but in practice it opened a further breach and left the Swiss open to further incursions. These steps, taken under intense foreign pressure, undermined what many traditionalists saw as a major element of the <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3740">Sonderfall</a></span> and intensified concerns about a <a id="page_276" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>national identity defined by traditional institutions and practices. The Lega even launched an initiative to write banking secrecy into the Constitution . Nonetheless, the right was also very critical of excessively high business salaries, reflecting the way that Switzerland, like much of western society, was experiencing a growing disparity between elite and mainstream salaries and wealth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Swiss international standing also came under attack from Libya after the brief arrest of one of Colonel Gaddafi’s sons in Geneva for abusing his servants. Oil supplies and flights were cut off, billions withdrawn from Swiss banks and Swiss businessmen taken hostage, leading the president in office, Radical Hans Rudolf Merz , to make an unauthorized and unsuccessful visit to Tripoli. Only painful negotiations and further humiliations, including having EU envoys defend the Swiss embassy, allowed the hostages to be released. This humiliation revealed Switzerland’s lack of real allies and weight, and may explain why the government tipped off US authorities that the filmmaker Roman Polanski was due to visit Zurich to receive a lifetime achievement award, enabling them to seek extradition. Although this was not in the end conceded, the affair won Switzerland widespread loathing among the international cultural elite.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The government, and the country as a whole, came under even greater pressure because of the SVP’s successful initiative of 29 November 2009 banning the construction of minarets in Switzerland, even though there were only a handful of them existing or planned. Designed by the SVP as a warning shot against possible Islamization, the initiative caused uproar abroad, especially in Arab countries. At home, it gave the party a new boost, because it had been able to win over non-core voters and push its own agenda forward. The SVP argued that Switzerland should resign from the European Convention on Human Rights if the ECHR declared its initiative illegal. It also went on to demand that the divided and incapable government resign, and to bring further pressure, it launched an initiative to secure the direct election of the Federal Council .</p>
<div class="fig" id="c19444-3618"><img src="../images/00058.gif" alt="" class="calibre5"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="label3">9.5 </span>SVP Poster. A typically aggressive, not to say inflammatory, example of the campaigning style, which had brought the SVP so many successes in recent years. Used in its successful campaign for the 29 November 2009 votation on banning the construction of minarets, it combines an attack on Islamic treatment of women with the suggestions that burka-wearers, no matter how pretty, are terrorists and that minarets are akin to long-range missiles. The implication is that Islam is threatening the destruction of Switzerland and its Christian heritage.</div>
<p class="calibre4">Banking secrecy again added to the country’s difficulties after a former employee of HSBC in Geneva handed over an illicit list containing the names of some 3,000 French citizens with undeclared accounts in Switzerland. This caused a good deal of tension with <a id="page_277" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a><a id="page_278" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>France , as did a German purchase of a similar list. The government tried to de-dramatize the issue, but many voices inside Switzerland argued that Switzerland could not go on refusing to recognize tax evasion as a crime and claiming that everybody else was in the wrong. The Federal Administrative Court’s decision that FINMA had exceeded its powers in transferring names of American clients of UBS to the US also left the government with a major problem. It seemed that banking secrecy might be lost and the country forced to accept automatic exchange of information about accounts with Swiss banks. However, the initiative to write banking secrecy into the constitution failed to garner enough signatures for a votation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although the Libyan hostage crisis was finally resolved in June 2010, the government was further battered by revelations that it had toyed with the idea of attempting an armed rescue, and then by a damning parliamentary report on the way it had managed the affair. This forced Merz to step down, but despite a spirited challenge from the SVP, the Radical s and Social Democrats both held on to their seats. The election of Simonetta Sommaruga for the latter meant that, for the first time, the Federal Council had a female majority. A controversial switch of portfolios also took place, with Doris Leuthard moving to Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications and Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf to Finance, relegating the new Social Democrat Minister to the Police and Justice Department.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In November 2010, 52.9 per cent of those voting rejected the government’s counter-project and backed an SVP initiative on expelling foreigners guilty of crime s. The SVP then increased its pressure on the establishment by launching a new programme and seeking to reverse prevailing schools policies. The party was also able to burnish its martyrdom image by holding its winter assembly in a snowy field, after having been banned from using a public hall. This helped it to maintain its support, whereas the SPS’s new anti-capitalist programme was badly received and its fair tax initiative failed badly on 28 November. The rejection in February 2011 of a pacifist initiative to ban the keeping of army weapons at home, because they were too often used in domestic murders, also showed the continuing strength of conservative feelings. The SVP was also able to snatch the Bernese seat in the Council of States left vacant by <a id="page_279" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>Ms Sommaruga, and to exploit the collapse of an apparent agreement to open negotiations with Brussels on a new framework deal with the EU, involving acceptance of the acquis. This helped effectively to block all progress on the EU dossier, notably on an agricultural free trade deal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The attention of both the electorate and the SVP was then caught by two unexpected issues that came to dominate the early stages of the 2011 election campaign. One was the panic caused by the Fukushima nuclear crisis in Japan, which turned opinion around and led the authorities to pledge an end to nuclear power by the 2030s, although no adequate replacement was agreed. The second, which soon overcame such environmental concerns, was alarm at the ever-increasing value of the Swiss franc, which became an increasing problem for export ers and many others, prompting fears of a depression. Attempts by the National Bank to check the franc’s rise proved of some effect, however, and may be developed further. The discovery of major fraud in the London branch of UBS also helped to focus attention on the growing European financial crisis.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The SVP sought to offset these new concerns by reviving fears about foreigners and asylum seekers; the party launched an initiative to establish draconian controls on the foreign population, attacked Sommaruga’s handling of asylum policy and made control of immigration one of the three planks of its revised ‘Contract with Switzerland’, in place of tax cuts. The SVP initiative ignored an actual fall in the number of asylum seekers and criticisms that Swiss policy was already in breach of human rights provisions. The party also brushed aside suggestions that its stance on Islam was close to that of Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik. The initiative was part of a huge surge of proposals made to attract public attention prior to the election. However, the party did not, at first, benefit hugely in the polls.</p>
<p class="calibre4">From early September a new element entered the equation with the announcement of the forthcoming resignation of Madame Calmy-Rey from the government, which focused attention on government formation. Yet the 2011 election campaign did not take off in the way that that of 2007 had done. This was despite the fact that, on the one hand, the election raised fundamental questions about the direction the country would take: would it remain consensual and <a id="page_280" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>outward looking, or would it continue to veer inward, changing both the political system and Swiss foreign policy ? On the other hand, the election failed to rouse much excitement despite the presence of an increased number of candidates and heavy spending on poster and press advertising, not to mention more use of new technology and social media. Habit, the proliferation of partie s and a recovering economic situation seem to have led voters to overlook the strategic dimension. The desire of the mainstream parties to avoid excitement, in case this might aid the SVP, also contributed to a lacklustre campaign and an only slightly increased turnout.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the event, the election did not produce a further destabilizing shift away from consensus politics. In fact, the SVP suffered its first losses in some twenty years, in both houses. It failed either to achieve a last-minute mobilization in elections to the National Council or to find sufficient allies in the non-proportional elections to the Council of States and the government. However, all the major parties initially lost ground, because the electorate seems to have been dissatisfied with party strife and the lack of clear answers to its economic needs. Conversely, the Green Liberals and the BPD both did well, together harvesting a tenth of all votes cast. The Ständerat run-off elections partly reinforced the resistance to polarization by inflicting several humiliating defeats on the SVP, often at the hands of the Social Democrats .</p>
<p class="calibre4">This partial rejection of polarized politics meant that, although the SVP remained by far the largest party and retained considerable potential for disturbing the system, it had to negotiate on its claim to a second minister when the time came to elect the Federal Council . In the event, its selections and strategy backfired, and it failed to win back the second seat that, on its psephological reading of consensus, it believes it deserves. Rather, its bête noire, Ms Widmer-Schlumpf , was both re-elected and nominated as Presiden t for 2012. More conventional understandings of consensus and the new-style Magic Formula , which stressed parliamentary balance and policy agreement, were thus reinforced at its expense. Indeed, the party briefly considered whether to withdraw again from government in protest against the denial of its governmental claims. It decided not to so so. It also maintained its direct democratic pressures on the system, even if these did not always succeed.</p>
<a id="page_281" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Yet the SVP remains a powerful and popular force. Consequently, a major shift in the political balance and the governance of Switzerland remains a possibility, although 2011 at least delayed it. For while religion, language and, to an extent, class have faded as sources of internal division, the identitarian divide remains. This still draws on history, as well as on institutions like direct democracy , with realities still being challenged by myths both old and new. In other words, if the Sonderfall ’s appeal is weakening, it has not yet gone away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Moreover, the country still has to decide on its attitude to an outside world that is presenting the Swiss with increasingly pressing challenges. Finding consensus on responses to new pressures from global population movements, new security problems, overdevelopment, the EU , the US , and the OECD , not to mention from currency markets disturbed by the Eurozone crisis, will not be easy. For even if the country’s economic, financial and social position remains stronger than that of many other European states, its political divisions are increasing and the system is no longer as stable as it was. Being a <span><a class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre" href="part0022.html#c19444-3746"><span class="italic">Willensnation</span></a></span> thus poses problems of its own. In fact the country has to decide whether it will stick to a cooperative line or build on Switzerland’s own xenophobic and ultra-right-wing tradition – which had emerged as its nineteenth-century revolutionary tendencies evaporated – and follow the present Europe-wide trend back towards a more competitive international order. Both at home and abroad, the SVP offers the country a very different future from that championed by majority opinion – and one which, despite the party’s stress on tradition, could lead to drastic change in the Swiss system.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Switzerland therefore remains under tension from within and without. In other words, it is going through yet another phase in its long evolution, showing again that it is not the pacific, politics-free place so many imagine. It remains, as it has long been, a real polity with real – and often conflictual – politics. And these are, more than ever, a matter of the interaction between a sense of distinctiveness, intellectually and especially because of its political system, and the country’s intimate connection with Europe. Out of this interaction will come the decisions which will continue the making of the Swiss.</p>
<a id="page_282" class="calibre2 pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre"></a>
<p class="calibre4">Although it may not yet be clear either how Swiss politics will evolve in future or where Swiss history may lead, we can be sure that Swiss history is far from coming to an end. Switzerland will continue to have a far more complex and striking history than most outsiders realize, and one most unlikely to follow a single simple trajectory. Indeed, because of its very particularity, Swiss history cannot serve as a model for others – anymore than can Swiss politics – but it remains fascinating and worth studying both for itself and because it offers a better understanding of the full range of possibilities that European polities have produced. It deserves to be rescued from the way it has been overlooked and misconstrued in recent years, and presented in its full richness and significance.</p>
